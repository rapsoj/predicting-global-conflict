The emergency decree covered high-crime areas in the country’s two largest cities, Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, suspending civil liberties, such as freedom of movement and assembly, and allowing police to make arrests and search homes without judicial warrants.\nOver the past two years, the Honduran government has extended and expanded the emergency into much of the country, including both urban areas affected by gang violence and less populated regions, such as the Atlantic Coast, used by the traffickers who bring South American cocaine into Honduras for transport across Central America and Mexico en route to the United States.\nBut the impact has been mixed, at best. The Castro government takes credit for reducing homicides, though murder rates have been falling (albeit unevenly) since peaking at 77 homicides per 100,000 people in 2011. Honduras remains one of Latin America’s most violent countries and suffers the region’s highest rates of femicide. And although extortion is notoriously hard to measure — victims tend to underreport for fear of gang retaliation — it remains widespread. A national survey by the Association for a more Just Society (ASJ), a Honduran NGO, estimated that during the first six months of the state of emergency extortion victimization increased, from 9 percent of households to 11 percent.\nMeanwhile in neighboring El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele’s crackdown beginning in March 2022 transformed the country in a matter of weeks. Impoverished neighborhoods that were once under gang control in San Salvador now seem to be largely extortion-free. Official homicide rates have plummeted to about 2.4 per 100,000 people, down from a peak of 100 per 100,000 in 2015. (Although critics argue the government is undercounting murders by excluding those killed in clashes with police or discovered in clandestine graves.)\nWhy has the impact of emergency measures been so dramatic in El Salvador and seemingly negligible in Honduras? The two countries are both in Central America’s turbulent northern tier, a region that emerged from military rule and civil war in the 1980s only to be overwhelmed by criminal violence in the early 2000s. Both have shared a common threat: powerful street gangs or maras — most notably the Mara Salvatrucha or MS-13 and Barrio 18 — that recruited impoverished, disaffected young people with the lure of income, power and identity. And both have sent millions of migrants (authorized and unauthorized) to the United States in search of safety and economic opportunity.\nDespite similarities, Honduras faces a more complex criminal threat than El Salvador with less capacity to meet it.\nBut despite these similarities, Honduras faces a more complex criminal threat than El Salvador with less capacity to meet it. The Salvadoran government’s relationship with the gangs — shaped by years of oscillation between confrontation and accommodation — is unique in Latin America. Moreover, its security and justice institutions were empowered to arrest tens of thousands of suspects and then keep them in prison without due process. This makes the Salvadoran model not only difficult to replicate but incompatible with democratic rule of law that safeguards fundamental rights.\nPromises Meet Realities\nXiomara Castro took office in January 2022 amid high hopes for social and political change. She had campaigned on a platform promising to build a “socialist and democratic state” that would protect human rights, curb corruption and demilitarize security. But toward the end of her first year in office, her government faced mounting criticism for failing to curb crime. Business leaders warned that extortion was out of control, affecting large and small businesses alike. Among those hardest hit were bus and taxi drivers, who in October 2022 shut down public transportation in Tegucigalpa, displaying coffins in memory of those killed for failing to make extortion payments.\nOn November 24, the Honduran Security Ministry responded with an “Integral Plan for the Treatment of Extortion,” which included legal reforms, technological and institutional improvements, community programs, prison reforms and mechanisms for institutional coordination. But the plan was pre-empted that same day when Castro announced that she was initiating her war on extortion by imposing a state of exception.\nCastro was following the example of El Salvador’s president, who had declared an emergency eight months earlier. She was also reneging on campaign promises to prioritize human rights and reduce the army’s role in domestic law enforcement. Her government doubled down in June 2023, giving the army control over prisons and a year later by announcing plans to construct a “megaprison” with the capacity to hold 20,000 inmates, a smaller version of CECOT (Terrorism Confinement Center), which holds 40,000, built by the Salvadoran government in 2022.\nCastro’s rhetoric also echoed Bukele’s. The leftist president, who had once stressed the need for community policing and social programs, called gang members “terrorists” and vowed to reform the penal code to institutionalize emergency measures by allowing authorities to detain gang leaders without charges and prosecute them in mass trials.  \nDespite the government’s increasingly hardline rhetoric, there is little evidence that the state of exception has curbed gang power to intimidate and extort. In some areas, the problem seems to be getting worse as new groups get in on the racket.\n“Our sector not only continues paying rent [extortion], but the rates have increased,” Jorge Lanza, a bus owner and transportation sector organizer, told reporters. “Other criminal bands have emerged. The urban transport sector remains the principal victim.”\nAnd gangs still dominate marginalized urban neighborhoods with high rates of poverty and underemployment. “The state of exception has had no major impact in the communities,” said Leo Pineda, who heads JUSIVE, an organization that works with at-risk youth in San Pedro Sula. “There’s no difference in terms of safety or gang control.”\nThe Criminal Landscape\nOne reason why the crackdown in Honduras seems more rhetoric than reality is the capacity of security forces. El Salvador, the smallest, most densely populated country in Central America, had about 418 police officers per 100,000 people in 2023, according to statistics compiled by the Association for a more Just Society. Honduras, which is four times as large as El Salvador with double the population, has only 184 officers per 100,000 people. President Bukele has also invested heavily in the armed forces with plans to double its size from 20,000 to 40,000 troops by 2026.\nThe Honduran government promised to increase the number of police officers from 18,920 in 2021 to 28,000 by 2026, which would mean training and incorporating about 1,800 new officers each year. Instead, the number of officers has decreased slightly over the past two years, from 18,047 in 2022 to 17,920 in 2023 to 17,436 in 2024, according to ASJ. \nBut perhaps the most important difference is that the two countries are confronting different criminal threats. Honduras faces not only street gangs, but also drug trafficking organizations, which have penetrated and corrupted government at the national and local levels. Castro’s predecessor, former President Juan Orlando Hernandez, was convicted in June 2024 in U.S. federal court for conspiring to smuggle tons of cocaine. His former police chief, Juan Carlos Bonilla, was convicted on similar charges in August.\nThere are also important differences between the nature of the gang threat in Honduras and El Salvador. Some analysts argue that the MS-13 has grown more sophisticated, moving into the drug business from local retail sales to international trafficking, to money laundering. The decline of homicides in some areas may simply be the result of changing criminal tactics.\n“The MS no longer extorts stores and small markets in the territories they control because they are more interested in the neighborhood being quiet,” a police official told researchers with ASJ. “It is better to have the citizen as a friend than as an enemy,” adding that the MS was “no longer a street gang. They are more like the Russian mafia.”\nMeanwhile new gangs have emerged. Bus and taxi companies are especially vulnerable because they pass through different criminal territories, paying off multiple groups on the way. Nor is extortion in Honduras limited to gangs. ASJ documented cases of gang imitators, such as public security and justice officials or private sector employees who use inside information to extract payments from their employers.\nA Problematic Prototype  \nThe Bukele model is seemingly straight forward: imprisonment on an unprecedented scale. The Salvadoran government has more prisoners per capita than any country in the world: over 70,000 suspects — an estimated 1,086 prisoners per 100,000 people — far outstripping the second highest incarceration rate in communist Cuba, which holds some 794 people per 100,000, and more than double the rate in the United States, which holds about 531 per 100,000. \nHow was the Salvadoran government able to rapidly detain tens of thousands of once fearsome gang members with virtually no resistance? Analysts cite a number of advantages unique to El Salvador:  Unlike other countries facing multiple criminal threats, Salvadoran law enforcement was able to impose a dragnet around gang strongholds in densely populated urban and suburban neighborhoods. Plus, they had more control of the penitentiary system, which allowed them to isolate imprisoned gang leaders from those still on the streets.\nSalvadoran authorities benefited moreover from their secret negotiations with imprisoned gang leaders.  This provided them with valuable intelligence, including a database of gang members and collaborators.  Political scientists Manuel Meléndez-Sánchez and Alberto Vergara argue that the gang pact drove a wedge between the leadership, who bargained for better prison conditions and protection from extradition, and the impoverished rank and file who remained outside. When police and military forces launched their lightning crackdown in 2022, they encountered almost no opposition from fragmented street gangs without the capacity to mount a coordinated response.\nEl Salvador’s president also enjoyed almost unchallenged executive power. Well before the crackdown, Bukele, with the help of a compliant legislature, had removed the attorney general, replaced all five judges on the Supreme Court’s constitutional chamber, and forced dozens of lower court judges to retire. That allowed the government to carry out mass arrests, suspend due process and keep suspects in jail without judicial interference.\nThe economic and social costs of holding massive numbers of prisoners are enormous. The country’s total prison population exceeds 100,000 or about 2.4 percent of the adult population. That deprives the economy of potentially productive workers and deprives hundreds of thousands of family members, most of whom were already living in poverty, of much needed income. The direct costs to the state are unknown because the emergency decrees allow the government to manage security spending without public oversight.\nSmarter Policing\nThe costs of insecurity are also enormous, however: violent crime in Latin America — a region with 8 percent of the world’s population but a third of world’s homicides — is a drag on economic growth, heightens inequality and fuels corruption. The Inter-American Development Bank estimated in a recent study that the direct costs of crime and violence came to about 3.44 percent of the region’s GDP, as measured in loss of human capital plus state and private spending on security. About half of the homicides in Latin America are related to organized crime and gangs, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, far higher than the estimated share (22%) in the world as a whole.\nThere are better alternatives to sweeping, unsustainable crackdowns that sacrifice civil liberties and democratic rights.\nCitizens throughout the hemisphere want tough action against organized crime. But there are better alternatives to sweeping, unsustainable crackdowns that sacrifice civil liberties and democratic rights. In Guatemala, an international commission helped reduce the country’s soaring murder rates in the 2010s by strengthening the capacity of prosecutors and police to identify and target criminal networks. In Mexico, the capital city — under then mayor, now president, Claudia Sheinbaum — halved homicides by a series of measures to strengthen civilian police forces, including investigative capacity. In Colombia, the city governments in Cali, Bogotá and Medellín reduced violence through a combination of targeted policing, rehabilitating and expanding public spaces, providing opportunities for youth and promoting civic education.\nIn the face of the powerful transnational groups that threaten countries throughout the region, there must be greater cooperation against the corruption that enables networks to spread from country to country, and protect the security and safety of vulnerable communities.  \nTo wage its “war on extortion,” the Honduran government needs to be tough, but also smart. That means skillfully and strategically partnering with the United States to broadly improve police capacity to confront criminal organizations, investigate their networks, prevent money laundering and curb corruption. It also means helping police gain the trust of local citizens, especially those in gang-dominated neighborhoods, so they can become active allies in the fight against organized crime.\nPHOTO: Military police patrol Flor del Campo, one of the most violent neighborhoods of Tegucigalpa, Honduras, Nov. 14, 2013.

Several senior members of the government suggested that the United States intended to use extradition as a tool to undermine the military and as a political weapon against government officials. \nDrug traffickers facing trial in the United States have made frequent references to President Castro’s family in their previous testimonies. Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, former leader of the once-feared Cachiros drug trafficking group, has repeatedly claimed that former President Manuel “Mel” Zelaya, Castro’s husband, accepted bribes when he was in office. He also alleged that Mel’s brother Carlos Zelaya used a clandestine airstrip in Olancho to bring cocaine into Honduras during that time. \nBoth Zelayas denied these allegations. But just days after President Castro signaled her intention to withdraw the extradition agreement, Carlos Zelaya told local press that he had met in 2013 with drug traffickers that he described as “businessmen.” He also resigned from his post as secretary of the national congress. \nHis son, Zelaya Rosales, resigned as defense minister soon after, in what he said was an attempt to let an investigation into his father proceed unhindered.  \nHonduras has had an extradition agreement with the United States since 1912, though the constitution originally blocked the country from extraditing its own citizens. That changed in 2013, when Juan Orlando Hernández, then president of Congress, pushed through a constitutional reform that expanded the government’s extradition powers. \nWhen he later became president, Hernández used extradition to send some of Honduras’ most powerful drug traffickers, including members of the Cachiros and Valles, to face justice in the United States. After completing his presidency, Hernández himself was extradited and ultimately sentenced to 45 years in jail for drug trafficking. \nA US State Department official told InSight Crime that extradition was a valuable tool that benefited the people of Honduras and the United States. “We strongly urge the Government of Honduras to reconsider this decision, as it will hurt efforts by Honduras and the United States to jointly fight drug trafficking and bring criminals to justice,” they said. \nA six-month notice period means that, unless Castro changes course, the extradition agreement will lapse on February 28, 2025. \nInSight Crime Analysis\nThe cancelation of extradition by the Castro government could be aimed at protecting key government officials from prosecution in the United States, and will certainly frustrate the ability of both countries to hold transnational organized crime groups to account. \nThe naming of the president’s close relatives during previous drug trafficking trials in the United States has likely rattled the family. The convictions of Honduran traffickers and politicians, including that of Hernández earlier this year, relied heavily on witness testimony over physical evidence, and have consistently resulted in guilty verdicts.  \nForeign Affairs Minister Enrique Reina stressed that the end of extradition was not aimed at protecting individuals close to the current government and said most of the extradition requests the government had received were for members of the opposition National Party. \nSEE ALSO: Juan Orlando Hernández Sentenced to 45 Years in Prison for Drug Trafficking\nMel Zelaya had previously told reporters that there was “no possibility” of canceling the extradition agreement. Castro’s Libre party had previously celebrated the extradition of Hernández, who is currently serving a 45-year prison sentence. \nExperts consulted by InSight Crime said that while extradition had not stopped the movement of drugs through the country, it had been effective in attacking the country’s largest criminal groups. \n“We’re going backwards in giant steps,” a Honduran official, who wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to the press, told InSight Crime. The judicial system “does not have the capacity to keep a high-level trafficker in prison for a day, let alone prosecute them.”\nLester Ramírez, a professor at the Central American Technological University, told InSight Crime that there was “not the autonomy nor the resources to investigate, and most importantly prosecute” serious organized crime cases in Honduras. \n\nIn a letter written by Hernández and published by his wife, he said that extradition was a “crucial instrument” in the fight against organized crime. He also told Honduran journalist Oscar Estrada that he did not regret implementing extradition despite his lengthy prison sentence, and said that Honduras’ “institutional weakness and the strength of cartels” made the help of the United States necessary.\n\nFeatured Image: The president of Honduras, Xiomara Castro, addresses her supporters during a protest demanding that Congress see through its constitutional mandate to elect new officials to the Attorney General’s office in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.

Rosen\nGuatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, often referred to as the Northern Triangle countries, have some of the most powerful street gangs in the Americas.[1] Governments have responded to gangs by implementing tough on crime policies. In this article, I argue that tough on crime policies have not been effective and have failed to solve one of the most important aspects that enables gangs and organized crime to flourish: corruption. The Northern Triangle countries have had a plethora of corruption scandals, even involving current presidents and their family members. Combating corruption and impunity as well as reducing the ability of criminal actors to penetrate the state apparatus should be the forefront of the policy agenda of governments in the region. This article focuses primarily on the cases of El Salvador and Honduras to illustrate the failures of tough on crime policies and the intricate, arguably symbiotic, relationship between the state and organized crime.\nGangs and Tough on Crime Policies\nThe Northern Triangle countries are home to street gangs like Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and the 18th Street (Barrio 18). The survey data consistently shows that gangs are not trusted by the populace. Central American citizens feel unsafe and are prepared to take extreme measures to combat gangs and organized crime.[2] Politicians tapped into the desire to combat gang-related violence. President Francisco Flores, for example, launched mano dura (iron fist) strategies in El Salvador. Subsequent presidents like Tony Saca from the right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance (Alianza Republicana Nacionalista–ARENA) party and Mauricio Funes of the left-wing Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional–FMLN) understood that these policies helped win votes, as citizens wanted to combat gangs and gang-related violence.[3]           \nMano dura policies have had several negative ramifications. First, mano dura strategies have resulted in the prison populations increasing. Police arrested and re-arrested suspected gang members and governments marketed the victories of the tough on crime strategies. El Salvadoran prisons did not have the capacity to handle the massive number of gang members being arrested.[4] Second, government officials separated gangs within the penal system after a bloody prison massacre in 2004.[5] This policy enabled gangs, which are divided into different cliques, to better organize while behind the prison gates. Third, prisons have become an essential part of the gang life. Researchers note that gang members in MS-13 are expected to serve time in prison to move into leadership positions (i.e., prisons are a rite of passage). Overcrowded prisons dominated by gangs remain an integral part of the gang life. Many of the founding members and top leadership are incarcerated in Central America today.[6]         \nFurthermore, tough on crime strategies have often led to more violence. Honduras was the most violent non-warring country[7] in the world in 2012 with a homicide rate of 85.5 per 100,000 people.[8] After the truce between the MS-13 and 18th Street gangs broke down in 2014,[9] El Salvador exceeded Honduras as the most violent country in the world with a homicide rate of more than 100 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015.[10]\nPresidents in Honduras and El Salvador credit decreases in the homicide rates in recent years to the tough on crime strategies, which have focused on deploying the police and military to the streets. Yet both countries have seen the security forces involved in massive human rights abuses. The El Salvadoran police, for example, have registered more than 11,900 forced disappearance victims. This is more than the number of disappearances that occurred during the more than a decade-long civil war.[11]\nCorruption: Understanding Structural Problems\nThe focus on combating gangs and gang-related violence have not addressed the issue of corruption.[12]  For instance, President Tony Saca of El Salvador stole more than $300 million and is currently incarcerated in El Salvador. President Mauricio Funes used to receive trash bags outside the presidential mansion. In total, he stole more than $350 million and fled to Nicaragua.[13]\nPresident Nayib Bukele also ran on a platform as someone who would combat corruption and gang-related violence. It, however, is alleged that he cut deals with the 18th Street gang when he was the mayor of San Salvador.[14] As president, he has been criticized for deploying the military to the parliament to pressure politicians to support his security plan.[15] And despite his tough on crime rhetoric and pledging not to separate MS-13 and the 18th Street gangs in prisons, journalists produced a lengthy report in September 2020 indicating that the Bukele government spent a year negotiating with MS-13.[16]         \nIn Honduras, President Juan Orlando Hernández vowed to combat crime and corruption. US government officials like General John Kelly, the former commander of the United States Southern Command, even praised the Honduran president for his efforts to combat drug trafficking.[17] One could argue that Honduras has become the quintessential narco-state. Tony Hernández, a former member of congress and the brother of Juan Orlando, was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to life in prison in the United States for drug trafficking. He had intricate relationships with drug trafficking organizations like Los Cachiros.[18] While Juan Orlando Hernández has denied the allegations that he is involved in drug trafficking and organized crime, federal prosecutors at the Southern District of New York referred to the president in the court documents, labeling him as co-conspirator number four. The documents later mentioned the president by name more than 50 times in a March 2021 filing.[19]\nNational strike against corruption in Guatemala, 27 August 2015\nSource: Nerdoguate, Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\nConclusion\nPoliticians in the Northern Triangle have doubled down on tough on crime policies. They have targeted some criminal groups while colluding with other criminal actors. Tough on crime policies have led to a proliferation in the prison populations, which serve as epicenters of criminal activity. Yet mano dura policies have not solved the underlying structural challenges impacting Central American countries: corruption and impunity. Corruption helps gangs and organized crime groups thrive, as they seek to penetrate the state apparatus. In the case of Honduras, it is difficult to see where the line between the state and organized crime begins[20] and ends given the intricate relationship between politicians like Tony Hernández and drug trafficking organizations.       \nInternational organizations, such as the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (Comisión Internacional contra la Impunidad en Guatemala–CICIG), can help countries combat corruption and impunity. Yet these commissions are vulnerable, as politicians may not want them investigating corruption. Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales, for instance, announced in August 2018 that CICIG would have a year to leave the country.[21] The removal of CICIG sheds light on the challenges that exist for international commissions seeking to reduce corruption.\nReducing the levels of corruption and impunity does not require passing paper tiger reforms. Said differently, passing new laws is not the solution, but rather the existing laws must be implemented.[22]  This requires political will and can be quite dangerous as gangs and organized crime groups can threatened the safety of people vowing to fight corruption. Ultimately, unless the underlying structural problems are resolved, the Northern Triangle countries will be stuck in a vicious cycle of crime, corruption, and violence.\nAcknowledgements\nThanks to the comments of the two anonymous peer reviewers as well as the editor.

We’re going to carry on. I want to get through because it’s horrible in our country. There’s nothing in Honduras.”\nBetween 7,000 and 8,000 migrants, including families with young children, have entered Guatemala since Friday, authorities say, fleeing poverty and violence in a region hammered by the coronavirus pandemic and back-to-back hurricanes last November.\nThe large contingent of Guatemalan security officers managed to stop the caravan from advancing beyond Vado Hondo, with the people in the caravan dispersing into the nearby hills or heading back the way they came.\n“Guatemala’s message is loud and clear: These types of illegal mass movements [of people] will not be accepted, that’s why we are working together with the neighbouring nations to address this as a regional issue,” the Guatemalan president’s office said.\nEven if the caravan does get past, Mexico is preparing hundreds of security forces to stop them at its southern border, arguing it must contain the spread of coronavirus.\nThe pandemic has battered Honduras’ economy, which last year suffered its worst contraction on record.\nAdvertisement\nGuatemalan soldiers block part of a Honduran migrant caravan in Vado Hondo, hoping to block the caravan's progress to the US border.

Other measures included creating stricter regulations for businesses selling SIM cards for cellphones, tracking phone numbers used by extortionists, and requiring motorcycles to have a license plate and helmet with matching numbers.\nDuring the press conference, the government also announced plans to implement a “follow the money” strategy, not to prosecute low-level collectors but to trace extortion payments and how they are laundered into the formal economy, investigating involved businesses.\nSEE ALSO: Extortion in Northern Triangle Worth Over $1 Billion Annually: Report\nNonetheless, the plan to employ these harsh measures comes after days of protests and marches in which taxi, bus, and truck drivers, transportation sector businessmen, and local business owners demanded protection, according to CNN Español.\nOnly about 1% of extortion cases are ever reported, making estimates about changes in extortion rates challenging to verify, according to Andreas Daugaard, a research coordinator at Asociación para una Sociedad más Justa (Association for a More Just Society – ASJ), the Honduran chapter of Transparency International.\n“There is certainly the perception of [surging extortion rates], and that is the message the transport sector is sending. However, since so few cases are ever reported, we don’t have any numbers to estimate the size of a current surge in extortion,” Daugaard, who co-authored a recent report detailing extortion in Honduras, told InSight Crime. Survey data cited in the report suggests extortion rates stand at the same level as they did in 2018.\nHondurans lose approximately 18 billion lempiras (roughly $737 million) a year to extortion fees, according to the ASJ report.\nThe forceful crackdown on gang activity in Honduras follows El Salvador President Nayib Bukele’s highly controversial but broadly popular “mano dura” (iron fist) anti-gang policy.\nInSight Crime Analysis\nWhile brazen extortion schemes devastating Honduran businesses and workers have caused Castro to implement the state of exception, the popularity of Bukele’s campaign to seize power from gangs could be another motivating factor.\nThe term impuesto de guerra (war tax) is how criminal groups in Honduras refer to their extortion schemes, particularly the MS13 and Barrio 18. Groups forcibly demand someone or a business to pay for “protection” while threatening them with violence.\nYet, while the traditional narrative is that the MS13 and Barrio 18 are responsible for virtually all the extortion happening in Honduras over the last ten years, this is not the current reality, according to Daugaard.\n“There are a lot of groups involved in this. Local, smaller local gangs, insiders within the police, within the judiciary,” said Daugaard. “The other big group is so-called imitators. People who don’t necessarily belong to any gang use the notoriety and fear of gang membership to extort. Once you mention ‘I’m from Barrio 18’ or ‘I’m from MS13,’ many people will automatically pay up.”\nExtortion schemes have also become easier to carry out as digital money transfers become more commonplace in Honduras. Using apps like TigoMoney, extortionists can demand faster payments that appear in the banking system as legitimate transactions. No electronic payment extortion cases end up in court, only extortion involving cash, which is becoming far less frequent, according to Daugaard.\nSEE ALSO: Mano Dura Redux: The Price of Mass Gang Arrests in El Salvador\nAdditionally, an ASJ report found that criminal groups have adapted their extortion schemes to offload risk. For example, instead of sending collectors around to demand payments, extortionists force bus drivers to gather payments from their colleagues and transfer the money directly.\nWhile some of the newly announced anti-extortion measures will do well to fight the changing extortion schemes in Honduras, it is unclear whether the militarized state of exception will be successful. Imprisoning thousands of gang members tends to entrench gang culture and embolden or strengthen groups instead of eradicating them.\nStill, the Honduran president has watched as Bukele has pummeled gangs into submission with his mano dura policy, reducing homicide rates and remaining one of the region’s most popular leaders. The fear that Honduras may follow suit is a credible one.\n“Extortion has an enormous impact in Honduras, financially and socially, but the perception is the state is not doing anything, and often rightly so,” said Daugaard. “The idea of a ‘strong man’ coming in saying we’re going to deal with it, and putting tens of thousands of supposed gang members in prison is super popular in El Salvador, and it’s super popular in Honduras. I think it’s clear that that’s what Castro is tapping into.”\nTagged:\nBarrio 18\nEl Salvador\nExtortion\nHonduras\nMS13\nSeries: Honduras Gang Crackdown\nRelated Content\nExtorsión desenfrenada en Honduras desencadena estado de excepción\nDate\n29 Nov 2022\nLa ofensiva antipandillas en El Salvador ahora tiene a opositores políticos en la mira\nDate\n21 May 2025\nAmplio cubrimiento de la investigación de InSight Crime sobre la MS13\nDate\n8 Apr 2022\nStay Informed With InSight Crime\nSubscribe to our newsletter to receive a weekly digest of the latest organized crime news and stay up-to-date on major events, trends, and criminal dynamics from across the region.\nSign up\nDonate today to empower research and analysis about organized crime in Latin America and the Caribbean, from the ground up.\nDonate\nWe go into the field to interview, report, and investigate.

Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador’s role in a deepening refugee crisis explores how the three countries are failing to protect people from violence, and also failing to set up a comprehensive protection plan for deportees forced by countries such as Mexico and the USA to return to life-threatening situations.\nEl Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras have become virtual war zones where lives seem to be expendable and millions live in constant terror at what gang members or public security forces can do to them or their loved ones.

These millions are now the protagonists in one of the world’s least visible refugee crises,” said Salil Shetty, Secretary General at Amnesty International.\n“Although countries like Mexico and the USA are utterly failing to protect Central American asylum seekers and refugees, it is high time for authorities in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to own up to their role in this crisis and take steps to tackle the problems that force these people to leave home in the first place.”\n“Millions of Central Americans are falling through the cracks, victims of countries that do not fulfil their responsibility to provide the international protection they need, and of their own governments’ utter inability and unwillingness to keep them safe from the most tragic end.”\nMillions of Central Americans are falling through the cracks, victims of countries that do not fulfil their responsibility to provide the international protection they need, and of their own governments’ utter inability and unwillingness to keep them safe from the most tragic end.\nSalil Shetty, Secretary General at Amnesty International\nEncarni Pindado/Amnesty International\nEncarni Pindado/Amnesty International\nRecord-breaking violence\nMurder rates in Guatemala and Honduras are also among the highest on earth.\nThe United Nations has ranked El Salvador as one of the deadliest countries on earth outside of a war zone, with more than 108 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015.\nIn Honduras the rate was 63.75 and in Guatemala it was 34.99 per 100,000 inhabitants.\nYoung people are the hardest hit by violence, with more than half of those killed in the three countries in 2015 under 30 years of age. \nYoung boys often join the gangs under duress, while girls are forced to become gangsters’\n“girlfriends” and are often sexually abused.\nEncarni Pindado/Amnesty International\nEncarni Pindado/Amnesty International\nShop owners and bus drivers are routinely extorted and forced to pay “taxes” to the gangs controlling their area. Those who fail to follow the strict unwritten rules of conduct are often abused or killed.\nMany young children across the three countries told Amnesty International they had quit school for fear of gang members and now have to spend all day at home.\nThe Salvadoran Ministry of Education has been reported as saying that 39,000 students left school due to harassment or threats by gangs in 2015 – three times the figure in 2014 (13,000). The teachers’ union said they believed the real number could be more than 100,000.\nIn some cases, teenagers are harassed and attacked by the security forces, accused of being part of a gang.\nSixteen-year-old Andrés (not his real name) is living in hiding in El Salvador after being arrested in May by security forces. He told Amnesty International they tortured him to confess to participating in a shootout and being a lookout for gangs in what seems a desperate attempt to show officials are trying to tackle the shocking levels of violent crime in the country.\nHe said the soldiers poured bottles of water into his mouth and nose, put his head in a puddle, stuffed sand into his mouth, jumped on his stomach, then kicked, punched and threatened to kill him unless he confessed.\nHis mother complained to the authorities about her son’s treatment and an investigation has been opened.\nAndrés is now constantly moving from house to house, afraid the men who abused him will find him, and is desperate to leave the country.\nEncarni Pindado/Amnesty International\nEncarni Pindado/Amnesty International\nNo protection\nThe relentless violence has led to a surge in asylum applications from Central American citizens in Mexico, the United States and other countries, reaching levels not seen since the region’s armed conflicts ended decades ago.\nAccording to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the number of asylum applications from people coming from the three countries has increased more than six times in the past five years, particularly in neighbouring countries and in the United States.\nBut despite overwhelming evidence that many asylum-seekers face extreme violence and potentially death if they are not granted asylum, deportations from Mexico, the USA and elsewhere have increased. The number of Guatemalans, Hondurans and Salvadorans deported from Mexico increased by nearly 180% between 2010 and 2015.\nSent back home to be killed\nFor Saúl, it is too late. The 35-year-old father of five was murdered in his native Honduras less than three weeks after he was sent back home from Mexico in July 2016 when his asylum application was rejected.\nA bus driver – one of the most dangerous professions in Honduras due to the control gangs assert over the industry – Saúl fled the country in November 2015 after he survived a shooting along with his two sons, who were severely injured. The police failed to follow up on his report or offer him protection.\nWhen Amnesty International spoke to Saúl in July, his final words were, “I feel like something is going to happen again, maybe to me.”\nHis wife and sons are now living in terror of what might happen to them.\nEncarni Pindado/Amnesty International\nEncarni Pindado/Amnesty International\nGovernment officials in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala were unable to confirm to Amnesty International how the US$750 million earmarked for the region as part of the US-backed Plan for Prosperity would be used to help deportees whose lives are at risk. The plan is aimed at tackling the root causes of migration as a way to stem the migrant flow and protect those who are deported back.\nEl Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have set up official reception centres for deportees. Deportees have to go through a short interview where a migration official asks them about any abuse they might have suffered during the journey. They are rarely asked about the violence they were fleeing in their own countries and any needs for protection they might have.\n“Reception programmes for deportees are a bad joke. A shiny building, a warm meal and a welcome banner will not keep these people safe from the horrors that await them back home,” said Salil Shetty.\n“Instead, what we need to see is an effective region-wide initiative to invest the international aid they are receiving into tackling what causes so many people to desperately flee their homes.”\n“Unless Central American leaders address the shocking current levels of violence in their countries, the region risks plunging back into its darkest times. Instead of stubbornly denying people are running away from violence, those in power should focus their efforts on trying to find solutions to it.”\nFurther Reading\nHonduras, Guatemala and El Salvador’s role in a deepening refugee crisis (Report, 14 October 2016)\nAMERICAS\nEL SALVADOR\nGUATEMALA\nHONDURAS\nKILLINGS AND DISAPPEARANCES\nNEWS\nPRESS RELEASE\nREFUGEES\nNEWS\nRelated Content\nCOUNTRY\nEl Salvador\nNEWS\nEl Salvador deepens siege on civil society\nNEWS\nHonduras: Amnesty International urges authorities to guarantee justice for the murder of Juan López\nNEWS\nGuatemala: UN committee calls for guarantees that no girl will be forced to become a mother\nPRESS RELEASE\nEl Salvador: Amnesty International declares Ruth Eleonora López, Alejandro Henríquez and José Ángel Pérez prisoners of conscience amid increasing repression \nRecently added\nIsrael/OPT: States must act now to halt Israel’s military takeover of Gaza City as famine officially declared \nSaudi Arabia: Deplorable execution exposes broken promise to halt death penalty for juveniles \nSlovenia: Facilitating the transfer of arms to Israel ‘alarming’ and violates international law\n8 Years On: Accountability needed for Myanmar atrocities against Rohingya\nUSA/Global: Tech made by Palantir and Babel Street pose surveillance threats to pro-Palestine student protestors & migrants  \nDONATE TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS\nTogether we can fight for human rights everywhere.

At least 46 women were killed in the prison on June 20, 2023; in response, President Xiomara Castro’s administration put all prisons under military control.\n© 2023 Reuters/Fredy Rodriguez\nAVAILABLE IN\nShare this via Facebook\nShare this via Bluesky\nMore sharing options\nKeynote\n  The Human Rights System Is Under Threat: A Call to Action\nTirana Hassan\nFormer Executive Director\nPresident Xiomara Castro has largely failed to deliver on her promise to strengthen human rights and democratic institutions in Honduras.\nHonduras continues to face longstanding structural challenges, including systemic corruption, political interference in the justice system, insecurity, a very large percentage of the population living in poverty, and lethal attacks against environmental defenders.\nIn February, Congress appointed a new Supreme Court. The 15 justices were selected from a list prepared by a committee based on merit, but legislators split vacancies among political parties, as in the past. As of October, selection of a new attorney general was delayed in Congress as parties fought to appoint a person friendly to their interests.\nAlso as of October, the government continued to negotiate with the United Nations secretary-general to establish a UN-backed international commission against corruption and impunity in Honduras.\nJudicial Independence and the Fight against Corruption\nThe 15 Supreme Court justices appointed by Congress in February will serve for a seven-year period. Legislators retained the partisan practice of allocating selections proportionally among political parties, but this time, they selected from a list prepared by a nominating committee and based on merit, which was an improvement. Legislators also complied with Honduras’ legal gender parity requirement and selected the country’s first Afro-Honduran justice.\nThe government and the UN secretary-general are negotiating the establishment of an international commission against corruption and impunity, pursuant to a memorandum signed in December 2022. Between July and October, a group of UN experts visited Honduras three times to assess the viability and legal framework of such a commission.\nIn July, Congress abrogated Decree 57-2020, which had hampered prosecutors seeking to obtain key documentation in corruption investigations, and modified Decree 93-2021, an obstacle to money laundering prosecutions. In August, Congress abrogated Decree 116-2019, which had effectively barred the Attorney General’s Office from investigating the misuse of public funds by legislators for up to seven years, pending an administrative audit.\nGabriela Castellanos, director of the Consejo Nacional Anticorrupción, an independent organization mandated by law in 2005 to fight corruption, left Honduras in June, having received threats after publishing a report on nepotism in the government. Castellanos returned after a month and continued her work denouncing corrupt practices.\nÓscar Chinchilla was appointed attorney general in 2018 in violation of a constitutional provision that mandates that the attorney general be selected from a list prepared by a nominating committee. Chinchilla’s term ended on August 31, 2023, and a nominating committee selected five candidates to replace him in a process that some civil society organizations said was influenced by political interests. Political jockeying continued in Congress, which, as of October, had not agreed on a new attorney general.\nAttacks on Human Rights Defenders\nFrom January through August, 236 human rights defenders were harassed, threatened, or attacked, and at least 13 were killed—compared to 11 killed in all of 2022—the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Honduras reported. Seventy-five percent of the defenders attacked and more than 90 percent of those killed were environmental or land defenders.\nIn January, environmental defenders Jairo Bonilla and Aly Domínguez were killed in Guapinol, Colón department. Previously, they had received threats aimed at stopping their activities in defense of the Guapinol and San Pedro rivers. In June, Oquelí Domínguez, Aly’s brother and also an environmental defender, was shot dead in Guapinol.\nThe mechanism Honduras created in 2015 to protect journalists, human rights defenders, and justice officials has serious flaws: It lacks financial autonomy, qualified staff experienced in human rights issues, and trust from defenders, who are afraid to provide personal information that could end up in the hands of those who threaten them.\nEconomic and Social Rights\nNearly 80 percent of rural Hondurans lived in poverty, having income below US$7 per day. Almost all of them lived in extreme poverty, making less than US$4 per day, according to the latest official data, which is from 2021.\nAs of March 2023, official data showed 14 percent of Hondurans could not read or write, with the rate reaching 31 percent for those aged 60 and older. Only 56 percent of children between 12 and 14, and 29 percent between 15 and 17, were attending school.\nOfficial data from March 2023 also showed that remittances were almost 8 percent of Hondurans’ total source of income. Remittances amount to 27 percent of GDP, the highest rate in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to 2022 World Bank data.\nPublic Security and Prison Conditions\nHonduras is one of the most violent countries in the world, with police reporting 3,661 murders in 2022, a homicide rate of 38 per 100,000 people. According to Insight Crime, a think tank and media organization that reports on crime and security, Honduras has the second highest homicide rate in Latin America and the Caribbean after Jamaica. Preliminary police data shows 2,341 murders from January through September 2023, a 16 percent drop over the same period of 2022.\nIn December 2022, President Castro declared an ongoing state of emergency in several parts of the country, including the capital district, suspending the rights to freedom of association and assembly and to be informed of the reason for arrest, among others. OHCHR in Honduras expressed concern about the extended use of the emergency without a comprehensive, rights-based public security policy. The government justified the emergency by pointing to a rise in organized crime.\nIn June, gang violence erupted in a women’s prison, resulting in at least 46 deaths. In response, the Castro administration put prisons under military control, a common measure in Honduras that yields no clear results and appears to heighten rights abuses.\nAs of September, prisons held almost 19,000 detainees, which is 72 percent more than their capacity. Almost half were in pretrial detention, official statistics show.\nWomen’s and Girls’ Rights\nBased on 2021 data from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, Honduras has the highest rate of femicide—defined as “the killing of a woman by a man in the context of unequal power relations between men and women”—in Latin America. The Centro de Derechos de Mujeres, a Honduran nongovernmental organization (NGO) that monitors media, counted 317 femicides from January through September 2023.\nAbortion is illegal in Honduras under all circumstances, with prison sentences of up to six years for people who have or perform abortions. In March, the newly appointed Supreme Court justices confirmed a previous ruling rejecting the argument that the ban is unconstitutional.\nIn March, Congress approved a law mandating comprehensive sexual education to help prevent teenage pregnancies. After fierce backlash from conservative groups, President Castro announced in July that she had vetoed the law.\nIn March, Castro signed an executive order ending a ban on the sale and use of emergency contraception.\nMigration, Asylum, and Internal Displacement\nFrom January through September, Mexico’s refugee agency reported 31,055 Hondurans had requested asylum there, second only to Haitians. Many continue on to the United States. Migrants face serious risks—including kidnapping, robbery, and discrimination—throughout their journey.\nFrom January through July, 32,727 Hondurans—12 percent of whom were children—were forcibly returned, the government reported. More than half were from the US, and more than one-third from Mexico.\nFrom January through September, 340,611 migrants entered Honduras without proper documentation or without following established procedures, higher numbers than seen in all of 2022. More than 45 percent of them were Venezuelans, followed by Cubans, Ecuadorians, and Haitians, each representing more than 10 percent.\nIn March, President Castro signed a law to boost government help for communities and individual victims of internal displacement. Gang violence and human rights violations caused the internal displacement of about 191,000 people between 2004 and 2018, the latest official data shows.\nSexual Orientation and Gender Identity\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in Honduras continue to suffer high levels of violence and discrimination in all areas of life, forcing some to flee the country. Cattrachas, a Honduran organization that monitors media reports, registered 40 homophobic or transphobic killings from January through October 2023.\nHonduras has failed to comply with key measures ordered by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 2021 in response to the killing of Vicky Hernández, a transgender woman, during the 2009 military coup. Among other requirements, the ruling ordered the creation of a protocol for criminal investigations in cases motivated by anti-LGBT bias and a procedure through which trans people could change their name and gender on official documents to reflect their gender identity. No such protocol or procedure had been established as of October.\nDisability Rights\nDeficiencies in public infrastructure, difficulties in accessing employment, mistreatment in public transportation services, and poor access to information are part of the barriers people with disabilities face in Honduras, according to a 2022 ombudsperson report, which estimates that 14 percent of Hondurans have some type of physical, sensory, intellectual, or psychosocial disability.\nKey International Actors\nIn March, Honduras broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan and supported the “One China” policy, which holds that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the People’s Republic of China. Honduras and China agreed that Honduras would participate in the Belt and Road Initiative, a trillion-dollar project to spur China’s investment and advance its foreign policy interests.\nAs a member of the UN Human Rights Council, Honduras maintained a hesitant stance on human rights throughout 2023. It abstained from voting on a resolution extending the mandate of a group of UN experts investigating systematic rights violations in Nicaragua and on renewing the mandates of the UN special rapporteurs on the human rights situation in Russia and in Belarus. It voted in favor of renewing the mandates of a group of UN experts investigating abuses in Syria and of the special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Iran, among others.\nBrowse Countries\n                  Choose\n                          \nAfghanistan\n                   Algeria\n                   Angola\n                   Argentina\n                   Armenia\n                   Australia\n                   Azerbaijan\n                   Bahrain\n                   Bangladesh\n                   Belarus\n                   Bolivia\n                   Bosnia And Herzegovina\n                   Brazil\n                   Burkina Faso\n                   Burundi\n                   Cambodia\n                   Cameroon\n                   Canada\n                   Central African Republic\n                   Chad\n                   Chile\n                   China\n                   Colombia\n                   Cuba\n                   Democratic Republic Of Congo\n                   Ecuador\n                   Egypt\n                   El Salvador\n                   Eritrea\n                   Eswatini\n                   Ethiopia\n                   European Union\n                   France\n                   Georgia\n                   Germany\n                   Greece\n                   Guatemala\n                   Haiti\n                   Honduras\n                   Hungary\n                   India\n                   Indonesia\n                   Iran\n                   Iraq\n                   Israel And Palestine\n                   Italy\n                   Japan\n                   Jordan\n                   Kazakhstan\n                   Kenya\n                   Kuwait\n                   Kyrgyzstan\n                   Lebanon\n                   Libya\n                   Malawi\n                   Malaysia\n                   Maldives\n                   Mali\n                   Mexico\n                   Morocco And Western Sahara\n                   Mozambique\n                   Myanmar\n                   Nepal\n                   Nicaragua\n                   Niger\n                   Nigeria\n                   North Korea\n                   Pakistan\n                   Papua New Guinea\n                   Peru\n                   Philippines\n                   Poland\n                   Qatar\n                   Russia\n                   Rwanda\n                   Saudi Arabia\n                   Senegal\n                   Serbia/Kosovo\n                   Singapore\n                   Somalia\n                   South Africa\n                   South Korea\n                   South Sudan\n                   Spain\n                   Sri Lanka\n                   Sudan\n                   Syria\n                   Tajikistan\n                   Tanzania\n                   Thailand\n                   Tunisia\n                   Türkiye\n                   Turkmenistan\n                   Uganda\n                   Ukraine\n                   United Arab Emirates\n                   United Kingdom\n                   United States\n                   Uzbekistan\n                   Venezuela\n                   Vietnam\n                   Yemen\n                   Zambia\n                   Zimbabwe\n               Protecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\nDONATE NOW\nGet Updates On Rights Issues Worldwide\nSign Up\nConnect With Us\nBlueSky\nX\nFacebook\nYouTube\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nTikTok\nFooter menu\nContact UsCorrectionsPrivacy PolicyPermissionsSite MapChild SafeguardingText Version\n© 2025 Human Rights Watch\nHuman Rights Watch | 350 Fifth Avenue, 34th Floor | New York, NY 10118-3299 USA | t 1.212.290.4700\nHuman Rights Watch is a 501(C)(3) nonprofit registered in the US under EIN: 13-2875808\nHuman Rights Watch cookie preferences\nWe use cookies, tracking technologies, and third-party analytics tools to better understand who is using the website and improve your experience.

    "full_text": "Gang Violence, Public Health, and Security in Honduras\nAlexis Henshaw\nDownload PDF\nDec 18 2014 • 2,548 views\nImage by markarinafotos (Moisen Saman. Cortesía de Sony World Photography Award 2008)\nThe security situation in Central America drew increased attention in 2014 as a result of both the ongoing domestic debate about immigration reform in the U.S. and the influx of unaccompanied minors into the country during the spring and summer. While the children entering the United States come from multiple Central American countries, Honduras alone is estimated to account for over one-third of all unaccompanied minors entering the U.S. since October 1 of last year (Robles and Shear 2014). The prevalence of street crime and gang violence in Honduras is well known: the country was ranked by the UN Office of Drugs and Crime as having the highest per capita murder rate in the world in 2011 and 2013, and both poverty and income inequality have been on the rise since the country’s 2009 coup (UNODC 2014; Johnston and Lefebvre 2013).\nWhile gang violence in Honduras has attracted attention for its role in driving emigration to the United States, I argue that this violence also represents a domestic crisis of public health on multiple levels. First, direct violence by gangs against civilians, rival gang members, and those within the gangs creates public harm. Second, the internal displacement of persons, which has contributed to the development of slums and shanty towns, deprives many citizens of basic services and places individuals at risk of developing chronic health conditions. Finally, gang violence inhibits public access to health care by limiting the general mobility of persons and health professionals in a country where access to health services relies upon the free movement of persons. In the following analysis, which draws on both existing research and on my experience in the field in Honduras, I argue that failure to recognize and address the public health issues associated with gang violence may produce a deeper crisis within the country.\nBackground\nThe current landscape of organized crime in Honduras has its origins in the United States, among the gang culture of Los Angeles. The largest gangs operating in Honduras today, Mara Salvatrucha and M18, originated in Los Angeles among communities of Central American migrants in the 1980s. At that time, many migrants arrived in the area from El Salvador and Nicaragua, fleeing civil wars in those countries, only to become the victims of street crime in L.A. Mara Salvatrucha was formed as a response to violence against Central American migrants by existing street gangs, and M18 became a later offshoot of this group. Within Central America itself, the gangs only took hold when members were deported from the U.S. or voluntarily repatriated after the end of the wars (Johnson 2014; Bruneau 2014). Even upon their return to the region, the gangs mostly dealt in petty crime until they entered into partnership with Mexican cartels like the Sinaloa cartel and Los Zetas, who offered the gangs more power and funding in exchange for their assistance in the drug trade (Johnson 2014; Longmire 2014; Diario el Heraldo 2013). In Honduras, the political and economic turmoil resulting from the 2009 coup that deposed president Manuel Zelaya may have also helped empower the gangs, as poverty and inequality has worsened in the intervening years (Johnston and Lefebvre 2013).\nThe United States, among others, has made attempts to support development and alleviate poverty in Honduras. In 2012, the country received about $57 million in bilateral aid from the U.S., with an estimated $33 million in additional aid coming from U.S. government agencies and regional initiatives (Meyer 2013). Health programs have been an area of interest to donors and to the government of Honduras. Approximately $9 million in aid from the U.S. State Department and USAID in 2012 was aimed at improving health in Honduras, and a national program offers cash aid to impoverished families who keep children in school and take them to regular checkups (Meyer 2013). Despite these efforts, health care remains inaccessible to many within the country, a point I will return to below.\nGang Violence and Public Health\nDirect Violence\nThe most obvious linkage between public health and gang violence is in the direct acts of violence committed by gangs. In a 2014 report, the UN Office of Drugs and Crime estimated the murder rate per capita in Honduras at 90.4 homicides per 100,000 people, the highest in the world. Honduras also had the highest murder rate per capita in the organization’s 2011 report (UNODC 2014). The organization further estimates that about 30% of all murders in the Americas were a result of gang violence (UNODC 2014). Although that figure includes countries throughout North, Central, and South America, it would be reasonable to conclude that in those countries where gangs wield greater power, they commit a higher percentage of murders.\nHomicide is only one dimension of gang violence, though. In 2012, the Programa Nacional de Prevención, Rehabilitación, y Reinserción Social (PNPRRS) conducted a study of gang activity in Honduras using surveys, interviews, and focus groups with current and former members of various gangs. They note that the majority of gang members in their study joined between the ages of 11 and 20, and that harassment, threats, and assaults are frequently used to coerce young people into joining gangs (PNPRRS 2012). While assaults represent a hazard to the physical well being of young people, exposure to daily harassment and the threat of violence certainly challenges the emotional and mental well being of Honduran youth as well. Young women face particular challenges. The PNPRRS estimates that women make up at least 20% of gang members [1]. Female gang members tend to hold subordinate positions and perform menial tasks like selling drugs, visiting incarcerated gang members, collecting protection money, and acting as lures for kidnapping victims – tasks which make them visible and place them at risk of arrest or retaliatory violence by those outside the gang. Some women interviewed also reported being victimized or knowing someone who was victimized by men within their own gang, particularly where they rebuffed sexual advances by male gang members (PNPRRS 2012).\nDisplacement\nThe forcible displacement of civilians by gangs also creates a less obvious health problem. While specific statistics on the number of evictions are likely inaccurate – owing to a fear of reporting gang violence to the police – alliances between gangs and Mexican drug cartels are thought to be influencing this practice. Evicting people from their homes is strategically advantageous for gangs, since abandoned homes can be converted to safe houses and meeting locations. Poor households are disproportionately affected by this displacement, which fuels the development and growth of favela-type encampments on the margins of cities. One such slum in the area of Comayagüela is estimated to contain as many as 10,000 residents (Diario el Heraldo 2012).\nThe public health risks faced by slum-dwellers elsewhere in the world are well documented. Such areas lack basic services like water, electricity, and sanitation. Dirt floors in poorly constructed homes have been linked to parasitic infections, which cause diarrhea and malnutrition in children (Cattaneo et al. 2009). Household air pollution from improper ventilation contributes to health problems including pneumonia, bronchitis, heart disease, and lung cancer. In children, exposure to household air pollution almost doubles the risk for childhood pneumonia, contributing to an increase in child mortality (WHO 2014). Women and girls are thought to be especially vulnerable, since they generally spend more time in the home and preparing meals (Wirth 2011). While aid groups and NGOs have made efforts to improve sanitation and housing in Honduras, the continued eviction of poor families from their homes threatens to undermine years of development work in the country.\nAccess to Health Care\nA third dimension through which crime and public health are linked is through access to health care. As mentioned above, access to health care is uneven throughout the country and many rural areas rely on mobile health clinics as their primary source of care. I accompanied one such clinic of medical practitioners and volunteers in the spring of 2013 [2]. During my time in the country, I saw that the availability of medical services to rural Hondurans is already hindered by poor infrastructure, rough terrain, and a lack of trained medical specialists. The professionals accompanying us included one dentist and five general practitioners, all from Honduras, and several pharmacy students from the United States. The doctors working with us noted that most doctors in Honduras are general practitioners. The small population of medical professionals makes specialization impractical, therefore most doctors must be prepared to handle a variety of tasks ranging from regular checkups to obstetrics and gynecology to emergency medicine [3]. Most of the doctors who traveled with us had permanent offices in Tegucigalpa, but received financial support from the government to make occasional visits to rural areas. The village where we spent most of our time was less than two hours from Tegucigalpa, but it was located mid-way up a mountain along dirt roads, and only received visits from health professionals three to four times annually [4]. Since most of the area’s residents did not have cars, the clinic was their only convenient way to visit a doctor or dentist, to get routine testing, to fill prescriptions, or to get professional medical care for their children. The Honduran government also uses data collected at these mobile clinics to track health trends.\nSince the mobility of health professionals is key to public health within the country, the impact of gang activity is a concern. Data on gang penetration has, thus far, focused mainly on urban areas of Honduras. Yet these gangs are unquestionably making inroads into rural areas [5]. If the spread of drug trafficking in Mexico is any indication, gangs involved in drug activities are likely to expand into rural areas of Honduras as they look to grow their operations and evade law enforcement. In urban areas, gangs already rule neighborhoods: collecting “war taxes,” monitoring daily comings and goings, and routinely interfering with public transportation (Bruneau 2014; Wilkinson 2013; Diario el Heraldo 2013). A nurse speaking to the Los Angeles Times in 2013 noted that violence among rival gang members attending her clinic in San Pedro Sula had forced her to cut back on clients (Wilkinson 2013). Should this pattern continue in more rural parts of the country, it would be hugely detrimental to a rural population that is almost entirely reliant on the mobility of medical professionals for access to care.\nA Way Forward?\nWhile the current discourse on Honduras in the United States centers on the link between gang violence and migration, the public health crisis linked to gang violence has gone largely unexamined. Left unchecked, gang violence threatens to undo years of development work in the country, and will almost certainly lead to the further deterioration of physical and mental health. The precarious state of public health also leaves Honduras exceptionally vulnerable, and an acute event like a natural disaster or an outbreak of disease could potentially lead to a new refugee crisis. Any discussion of further aid and assistance to Honduras should take these factors into account. Without addressing the human security issues underlying youth migration, any attempt to deal with the issue of migration itself is likely to be a short-term solution. By allocating funds and resources to disrupting gang activity, the United States and the international community can not only prevent Honduras from losing the gains it has made in health and development, they can also insure against the potential future costs of a public health crisis in the country.\nNotes \n[1] 20% was the figure they noted based on surveys and focus groups, though they suggest the number may actually be higher because many romantic partners of male gang members hold an ambiguous status (PNPRRS 2012).\n[2] During my time in Honduras, I accompanied a group that included Honduran medical professionals, staff from the nongovernmental organization Global Brigades, and volunteers from the University of Arizona’s College of Pharmacy.\n[3] They must also be prepared to handle a high volume of patients. On average, over 130 people visited our clinic per day.\n[4] Indeed, even in villages that are fortunate enough to have permanent health clinics, those clinics are still served by doctors who rotate in and out. In our case, the village of Cuesta Grande did have a small, two-room medical center. We used that building for women’s health exams, while the majority of patients were seen down the street in the village school. Classrooms were converted into a pharmacy, a dental room, and a medical room for the occasion. Patient intake and childcare took place outdoors.\n[5] While in transit to the medical clinic, our group was accompanied at all times by an armed military escort. This seems to reflect the government’s concern that equipment, medication, and/or personnel could make attractive targets for criminal elements.\nReferences \nBruneau, Thomas. 2014. “Street Gangs in Central America: Combating them with Intelligence Fusion Centers.” E-International Relations.

Not only had Zelaya raised the monthly urban and rural minimum wages to a whopping $290 and $213, respectively, he had also shown himself to be more willing than his predecessors to listen to the complaints of impoverished communities affected by mining and other toxic operations by international corporations. All of this naturally indicated that the communist apocalypse was nigh.\nThe last straw came in the form of a nonbinding public opinion survey, scheduled for June 28, in which citizens would be asked whether they supported the inclusion of an extra ballot box at upcoming elections in order to then vote on whether to convene a constituent assembly to update the national constitution. As the Honduran right-wing and concerned gringos spun it, this was concrete proof that Zelaya was scheming to abolish the constitutional article that limited presidents to a single term and to thereby install himself as eternal dictator. Of no consequence, apparently, was that any constitutional tweaking would only take place after Zelaya had already left power. Eventually, the article in question was abolished anyway, albeit under a sufficiently ultra-rightist administration so as not to merit a peep from the guardians of democracy.\nIn the months following Zelaya’s pajama-clad expatriation, the United States busied itself hemming and hawing over how to categorize his ouster without resorting to the obvious descriptor — “military coup” — that would then trigger massive cutoffs in aid to the post-Zelaya allies. After initially declaring that the United States was “withholding any formal legal determination” regarding the Coup-Type Thing in Honduras, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton set about “strategiz[ing] on a plan to restore order in [the country] and ensure that free and fair elections could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of Zelaya moot and give the Honduran people a chance to choose their own future.”\nThis, at least, is what she herself told us in her 2014 memoir Hard Choices, in a passage mysteriously excised from the paperback edition the following year. New elections were indeed swiftly held, and mootness rendered — although it’s anyone’s guess as to how elections staged after an illegal coup could qualify as legitimate, particularly when the Honduran people had already chosen Zelaya to serve out his four-year term.\nWhen I arrived in Tegucigalpa, exactly a month after the 2009 coup, Honduran men and women had once again found themselves in the crosshairs, as peaceful anti-coup marches were routinely met with maniacal opposition by Honduran soldiers and police. At the beginning of July, for example, Honduran teenager Isis Obed Murillo had been fatally shot in the head by security forces at a pro-Zelaya rally. A schoolteacher was shot at a subsequent demonstration, also fatally and in the head, after which the prominent Honduran newspaper El Heraldo obediently explained that the man “had abandoned his classroom in order to go out and protest in the streets,” in case there was any doubt about who was to blame for his murder.\nWhile the Honduran golpistas and right-wing media didn’t much care when protesters were injured or killed, any reports of potential vandalism by the anti-coup crowd was cause for hysteria. Coup president Micheletti, predictably baptized the “first national hero of the twenty-first century” by the Honduran National Industrial Association, took it upon himself to condemn the application of graffiti to the “walls of private and state-owned establishments and the walls of churches” as “a great sin.” US fast-food chains and other corporate iconography — all-pervasive features of the Honduran landscape — were also near and dear to right-wing hearts.\nIn August, for example, one of the Tegucigalpa branches of Popeye’s was set ablaze following a month and a half of brutal military and police repression of peaceful marches. The ensuing grief and rage on behalf of this fast-food restaurant were almost sufficient, it seemed, to merit a national day of mourning. When I later made the mistake of suggesting to a Honduran university student with designer sunglasses and an SUV that the anti-coup resistance was perhaps actually nonviolent, she resurrected the brief demise of Popeye’s and put an end to my blasphemy, throwing in for good measure some demographic analysis: 80 percent of Hondurans were thugs, 80 percent of Hondurans were by coincidence also poor — lest there remain any doubt that poverty itself was a crime — and it was these statistics that were to blame for Zelaya’s overwhelming popularity. Never mind that overwhelming popular support automatically made Zelaya a representative of Honduran democracy and not, as the SUV-er contended, its enemy.\nWhich brings us to one of the golden rules of the Right: when democracy fails to deliver, invalidate the demos. From the perspective of the pro-coup crowd — many of whom had learned the joys of democratic freedom from fancy shopping trips to my own exclusive homeland — the real pueblo hondureño was whatever the elite minority said it was, regardless of whatever thoughts the ignorant and uncivilized masses might have on the matter. Meanwhile, the excessive violence perpetrated by the US-backed Honduran state against a range of domestic have-nots was in no way whatsoever to blame for Honduras’s increasingly violent state of affairs; ditto for the US habit of inundating the region with weapons.\nFor some idea of what non-elite Hondurans have traditionally been up against, it’s useful to revisit a 2002 report on Honduras from the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, in which Special Rapporteur Asma Jahangir warned that “every child with a tattoo and street child is stigmatized as a criminal who is creating an unfriendly climate for investment and tourism in the country.” The popularity of this attitude coupled with “institutionalized impunity” had, Jahangir noted, resulted in a pattern of extrajudicial killing of children by Honduran security forces: “In most of the cases the child was unarmed and did not provoke the police to use force, let alone lethal force.”\nNor did the extrajudicial business subside in subsequent years. When I met in 2009 with María Luisa Borjas, the former chief of internal affairs for the Honduran police, she lamented that some three thousand young persons had been murdered by the state during the presidency of Zelaya’s predecessor, Ricardo Maduro (2002–6). The killing spree had been made possible, Borjas said, by a de facto criminalization of youth and a liberal application of the term “gang member” — a policy inspired by none other than the “zero tolerance” approach of ex–New York mayor Rudy Giuliani.\nI attended various marches in the company of a severely diabetic schoolteacher and his daughter from Zelaya’s hometown of Catacamas, who supplied me with red bandanas and other resistance wear. Among the songs and chants frequently heard was the Argentine “Nos tienen miedo porque no tenemos miedo” — “They’re afraid of us because we’re not afraid” — which seemed to apply to pretty much everyone present except me.\nThe vibrant solidarity of the crowds, which somehow never abated even after hours under the sun and the ever-present danger of military and police assault, was all the more noteworthy given what these crowds represented: this was not just about the rejection of an illegal coup or a demonstration of undying dedication to the figure of Zelaya, this was about defiance of an entire history of right-wing attempts to crush the aspirations of a people.\nFlash forward to 2012, and an op-ed appeared in the New York Times detailing Honduras’s post-coup descent “deeper into a human rights and security abyss” that was “in good part the State Department’s making.” Written by University of California scholar Dana Frank, the piece slammed the Obama administration for recognizing the fraudulent November 2009 elections that brought Porfirio Lobo to power.\nCiting reports that more than three hundred people had thus far been killed by state security forces since the coup, with at least thirty-four members of the Honduran opposition disappeared or killed, Frank noted that no fewer than thirteen journalists had been reported murdered since Lobo’s ascension to office. And yet the United States, true to form, had “maintained and in some areas increased military and police financing for Honduras [while] enlarging its military bases there.”\nIn a 2014 dispatch for Al Jazeera America, Mark Weisbrot of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC highlighted some related  aspects of the coup fallout for which Washington was more than slightly responsible: “The homicide rate in Honduras, already the highest in the world, increased by 50 percent from 2008 to 2011; political repression, the murder of opposition political candidates, peasant organizers, and LGBT activists increased and continue to this day. Femicides skyrocketed.”\nOf course, state repression in Honduras is more than compatible with US financial interests and corporate exploitation. And what do you know: the slogan of the Lobo government was “Honduras Is Open for Business.” This was a relief to international investors fearful at the prospect of the country’s economic sovereignty, but decidedly less heartening for Hondurans whose lives happened to stand in the way of “business.” According to the NGO Global Witness, for example, Honduras was the “deadliest country in the world for environmental activism” in 2017. Among those recently assassinated was Berta Cáceres, a fierce campaigner for indigenous land rights and against environmentally destructive megaprojects.\nThe Guardian’s Nina Lakhani, relaying the claim by a former Honduran soldier that Cáceres’s name had appeared on a hit list belonging to US-trained Honduran special forces, stressed that human rights groups had warned the US Congress “that death squads were targeting opposition activists [in Honduras], much like they did during the ‘dirty war’ in the 1980s.” To put it a different way: Honduras was not just open for business, it was back in business.\nAnd in business it has remained under Juan Orlando Hernández, who was reelected in November 2017 in a vote widely denounced as extremely dubious (as previously mentioned, his reelection was made possible by scrapping the constitutional article limiting presidents to a single term — the very article that Zelaya was accused of violating and that was used as grounds for his overthrow). Post-election protests triggered a typically lethal response from the Honduran forces of law and order, while, in the midst of the vicious crackdown, the New York Times informed readers that the US State Department had just “certified that Honduras was meeting human rights conditions, strengthening transparency, and cracking down on corruption” — a prerequisite for the release of yet more US aid to those very same forces.\nIn October 2018, a US-bound caravan originating in the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula attracted thousands of Central Americans hoping to reach the United States by foot — a journey that would take well over a month. The decision to travel as a large group mitigated the dangers generally faced by migrants, including murder, disappearance, and rape.\nPredictably, the mass of peaceful pedestrians slowly inching their way northward lit a fire under Trump’s ass, and he took to Twitter to warn that “criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in” with the caravan: “I have alerted Border Patrol and Military that this is a National Emergy [sic].” Ten days later, he threatened to dispatch as many as fifteen-thousand additional troops to the southern border — on top of all of the personnel already stationed there — to fend off the encroaching enemy. After all, there is pretty much no better way to attack the United States than by walking there from Honduras.\nBut while Trump & Co. battened down the hatches, a critical history lesson was lost in the ruckus: US foreign policy in Central America over the past several decades is largely to blame for US-bound migration in the first place. It’s no coincidence that the caravan initiated in Honduras, the epicenter of recent US meddling in the region.\nAnd yet the US commitment to nurturing a violent Central American milieu is nothing new; back in 1954, for instance, the CIA-orchestrated coup against democratically elected Guatemalan president Jacobo Árbenz — a character insufficiently obsequious to US corporate interests — paved the way for a war in which more than two-hundred-thousand Guatemalans were killed or disappeared, many of them indigenous Mayans. From Guatemala to El Salvador and Honduras and beyond, it’s difficult to argue that US support for dictators, death squads, and egregious socioeconomic inequality has nothing to do with the present panorama of poverty and violence that Central Americans are fleeing. If anyone’s suffering from a National “Emergy,” it’s them.\nThe US obsession with the sacrosanctity of its own borders clearly hasn’t stopped it from violating everyone else’s. But there’s no time to waste contemplating double standards when evil incarnate is coming at you from all directions — hence the utility of converting a caravan of humans seeking a better life into a nebulous mass of criminal-terrorist-gang-member-rapists. Honduran president Hernández, meanwhile, did his own part to spice things up by proclaiming the whole shebang a leftist conspiracy financed by Venezuela.\nIt’s like a scene out of the Cold War circa 1986, when that pre-Twitter Emergy known as Sandinista Nicaragua compelled President Reagan to address his fellow Americans on the matter of the “mounting danger in Central America that threatens the security of the United States.” Nicaragua, a mere “two-hours’ flying time from our own borders,” was at the time the go-to spot for international evildoers, harboring “Soviets, East Germans, Bulgarians, North Koreans, Cubans and terrorists from the P.L.O., and the Red Brigades” and endorsed by “Arafat, Qaddafi, and Ayatollah Khomeini.” Furthermore, the president professed to “know [that] every American parent concerned about the drug problem will be outraged to learn that top Nicaraguan Government officials are deeply involved in drug trafficking” — though parents would presumably have been more outraged to learn that the United States and its Contra mercenaries were up to their ears in the drug business and more than slightly to blame for the crack cocaine epidemic that devastated South Central Los Angeles.\nThe moral of the story, according to Reagan, was that there was no conceivable “greater tragedy than for us to sit back and permit this cancer to spread” — i.e. the United States needed to funnel more money to the “freedom fighters struggling to bring democracy to their country and eliminate this Communist menace at its source.” This would also, incidentally, help avert a situation in which “desperate Latin peoples by the millions would begin fleeing north into the cities of the southern United States, or to wherever some hope of freedom remained.” As for how the noble battle for freedom played out in reality, Noam Chomsky has described the US Contra war as a “large-scale terrorist war against Nicaragua, combined with economic warfare that was even more lethal.”\nLuckily for the United States, there is no shortage of imperial lapdogs who claim that the gringos have brought only good things to Central America. Back in 2000, for example, Thomas Friedman crowed with delight over the perks of life in the Honduran homeland: “Honduras, little Honduras, already exports seven times more textiles and apparel to the United States than all forty-eight nations of sub-Saharan Africa combined.” He followed up this absurdity five years later with an intervention on behalf of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), according to which, he explained, the United States would altruistically offer Central America the opportunity to engage in “labor-intensive sewing” and thereby “help consolidate these fragile democracies by locking in a trading relationship with the United States that is critical for their development.” He subsequently boasted in reference to the article: “I wrote a column supporting the CAFTA, the Caribbean Free Trade initiative [sic]. I didn’t even know what was in it. I just knew two words: free trade.”\nWith little Honduras now locked into an ever-tighter bond of economic servitude and human rights obliteration disguised as democracy consolidation, one can’t help but feel that, in terms of empire-building, Honduras has been one hell of a coup indeed.\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nCONTRIBUTORS\nBelén Fernández is the author of The Imperial Messenger: Thomas Friedman at Work, Marytrs Never Die: Travels through South Lebanon, and, most recently, Exile: Rejecting America and Finding the World.

One salient example of the game’s ability to directly impact global politics is the armed conflict between Honduras and El Salvador in 1969–the so-called “Soccer War.” Although three 1969 World Cup qualifying matches (for the 1970 Mexico City World Cup) were the spark that ignited the conflict, the war stemmed from tensions much deeper than sport alone. In particular, a combination of border disputes and class tensions that existed for several years before the 1969 matches set the stage for the war. The three matches that were played in June 1969 served as “the catalyst which helped to ignite an already inflammable situation.”[1] Author Eduardo Galeano sums up the tension that spilled over from the matches into greater society: “Soccer, metaphor for war, at times turns into real war.”[2] The Soccer War is thus a bloody reminder that the implications of sport can reach far beyond the field.\nThe aggressive physicality of football can often lead to hostility among fans, and the Football War is no exception; it is an example of nationalistic football fervor quickly escalating into nationalistic violence. Rowdy fans from both nations started post-game riots that helped push their armies into a war that had been on the precipice of eruption for years. While foreigners often dismissed the conflict as mere rioting after an emotionally charged sporting event, the seriousness of the crisis was made clear on July 14, 1969, when Salvadoran planes dropped bombs on the airport in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, effectively declaring war on neighboring Honduras. Four days later, most of the fighting in the “100 Hours War” had ceased, but the ramifications of the conflict remained for decades.\nBackground\nGames\nWar and Aftermath\nPress Propaganda Campaign during the Football War (July 14-18, 1969)\nResults of the Propaganda Campaigns\nOAS Background\nPolitical Unrest and Ongoing Disputes: 1969-Present\n2009: The Lingering Legacy of the Football War\n  Background\nAs soccer aficionado John Turnbull put it, “Football is a game of contested space.”[3]; in Honduras and El Salvador, this truism extends beyond the pitch. The issue of space is relevant in the context of the Soccer War because Honduras is about five times as large as El Salvador in square mileage[4]. In 1969, Honduras had a population of 2,333,000 in 1969, compared to El Salvador’s 3,000,000. The overcrowding in El Salvador resulted in a decline in quality of life for a large number of Salvadoran citizens, and many spilled over to nearby Honduras, which was less densely populated. These immigrants began to take jobs as factory workers and cultivators of previously barren land. A growing resentment began to emerge among many rural Hondurans, who witnessed Salvadoran immigrants in their communities holding jobs and profiting off of the land. Both governments tried to stem the tide of unauthorized immigration and resultant border disputes by reestablishing the border between the two countries; however, a string of treaties intended to solve the problem were met with public contempt. The last of these treaties, the Bilateral Treaty on Immigration, though defunct by 1967, endures in popular memory as resentment is still felt by both sides.\nBy the time that the first qualifying match took place between Honduras and El Salvador in 1969, there were 300,000 Salvadoran immigrants living and working in Honduras. This considerable immigrant population accounted for approximately 20% of Honduras’s peasant population. As border disputes continued to simmer and resentment towards the Salvadoran workers grew, soccer matches between the two countries were poised to arouse nationalist passions that would escalate the conflict and provoke a war.\nBack to the Top\nGames\nBefore any of the games had even begun, there was hostility between fans due to the recent border disputes. According to reports, “the El Salvadorian side were kept up all night by riotous fans outside their hotel.”[5] The first of the three World Cup qualifying matches took place in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital. The game went through the 90th minute without either team scoring. Late in overtime, Honduras finally scored a goal to win the game. Fans immediately started rioting and fighting in the stands at the stadium. Some onlookers even reported that the stadium was set ablaze[6]. The fans on the Salvadoran side were angered by the Honduran victory, and their dissatisfaction that was compounded by the Salvadoran media, which used the game to create “a point of national honor.”[7] After the match, reports surfaced about the suicide of a Salvadoran woman at the conclusion of the game. The Salvadoran media covered the death in detail and showed the funeral on national television.  Through this arguably propagandistic and jingoistic coverage, Salvadoran media galvanized antipathy against the Honduran soccer team and the entire Honduran nation.\nOfficial 1970 World Cup Program\nThe events leading up to the second match suggest that the Salvadoran media had effectively infuriated the Salvadoran people. When the Honduran team reached the airport in El Salvador, they were immediately accosted by hordes of Salvadoran fans. Fans singled out Honduras’s star player, Enrique “the Rabbit” Cardona, and held up posters of him being beaten by a rabbit. The night before the game, General José Alberto Medrano led fans of El Salvador in a riotous march through the streets, hoping to disturb the Honduran team’s sleep and affect their performance the next day. At the end of the night, two men lay dead in the street, “and seven persons were injured by the police.”[9] Hondurans bemoaned the street violence, “their women defiled, their menfolk assaulted and the national flag desecrated.”[8]  At some point in the night, the Honduran players were escorted out of the hotel and taken to safety at their own embassy.\nDuring the match the next day, the effects of the previous night’s riots were manifested on the pitch. Hidden in an undisclosed location before the match, the players were tired and feared for their lives. During the pregame ritual, Honduras’s flag was not flown–  in a show of spite, the Salvadorans hung a rag to which the Hondurans sung their national anthem. As expected, El Salvador dominated the match, scoring three goals in 4 minutes by Juan Ramón Martínez, Elmer Acevedo, and Juan Ramón Martínez respectively.[10] After the match, the Salvadorans celebrated uproariously. There were riots in the streets, but this time out of jubilation rather than loathing. Honduran star Enrique Cardona recalls that “We’re awfully lucky that we lost.  Otherwise we wouldn’t be alive today.”[11]\nAfter the first couple matches, violence continued as local gangs in Honduras terrorized Salvadoran settlers, trying to drive them out of neighborhoods and back into El Salvador. If the settlers refused to leave, Hondurans burned their houses to the ground. The Salvadoran media did not take kindly to this turn of events: one Salvadoran newspaper reporting these events stated, “El Salvador should civilize Honduras by force.”[12] In response to the unrest and menace of violence, Salvadorans began to stream back across the border into El Salvador. Overall, an estimated 17,000 refugees fled Honduras for the safety of their homeland. As tensions and violence grew on both sides, war became increasingly inevitable.\nWith the first two matches clouded by such intense violence, soccer administrators decided to hold the third match in Mexico to lessen the any chance of further aggression between the two nations. Before the final match, Argentine Gregorio Bundio, coach of the El Salvador side, was called into the Salvadoran president’s home. The president told him that he “had to defend the national colours, because this match was for our national dignity.”[13] The pressure for both sides to perform well on the neutral Mexican pitch with the world’s eyes upon them was immense. Once again, the match went well into overtime. El Salvador struck first, with goals in the 10th and 29th minutes scored by Juan Ramón Martínez, and Honduras answered with two goals to tie the game. Both sides exhibited a fierce desire to win– the defense was so intense that, when recalling the game, Cardona exclaims, “They kicked me off the pitch!” José Antonio Quintanilla of El Salvador finally scored the winning goal in the 101st minute.[14] After this victory diplomatic relations were broken off by each government, the first steps towards war.\nBack to the Top\nWar and Aftermath\nOn July 14, 1969, the “Soccer War” officially began when three El Salvadoran fighter aircrafts made an incursion into Honduran airspace. Soon afterward, the Salvadoran army made immediate advances towards the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, and launched attacks on the main road connecting the two countries. Better equipped than its Honduran counterpart, the Salvadoran army pushed easily ahead. The advance continued with the capture of Nueva Ocotepeque, a city in southwest Honduras, but the Salvadoran army then “began to encounter stiff resistance.”[15] A combination of inclement weather, resistance by Honduran citizens, and lack of ammunition caused the Salvadoran offensive to grind to a halt. The Honduran air force retaliated with strategic bombings of oil refineries and major power centers of El Salvador. With both sides running out of ammunition, a ceasefire was eventually called by the Organization of American States (OAS) and went into effect on July 20th. Both sides suffered losses of over 2,000, extreme given the brief duration of the war. More than 100,000 Salvadorans were displaced by the conflict, a shift with profound effects on the Honduran economy; those displaced left a chasm in the markets where they once participated actively. Most of the casualties on the Honduran side were citizens who took part in resisting the advances of the Salvadoran troops.\nMany people did not even remotely understand the true social and political causes of the war. Juan Luis Gutierrez, a Honduran soldier who fought in the conflict, says, “We soldiers didn’t have a clue. We went to war not knowing what we were fighting for or why. They just told us to defend the national sovereignty.” [16] Through the use of media propaganda, which evoked national emotions and pride, both countries were able to convince their respective citizens that sovereignty was at stake and that there was a legitimate reason to fight this war. The war may not have been caused by the soccer matches directly, but it is a prime example of how the emotions and violence stirred up in the games can easily spill over from the pitch onto the streets.\nBack to the Top\nPress Propaganda Campaign during the Football War (July 14-18, 1969)\nThe overarching mystery of this conflict is why it spread beyond the diplomatic arena and how armed aggression was both easily conducted and justified. The answer lies in the propaganda campaigns fueled  by both nations. While Latin American integration and international incorporation into the Central American Common Market have always been underlying objectives in Latin American history, the Football War and its propaganda schemes served as a harsh departure from such goals and illustrated the volatility inherent in Latin American relations. The propaganda campaigns willingly prevented peace settlements that would have been instrumental in the restoration of the Central American Common Market.\nThe propaganda campaigns during the Football War alluded to three key principles. The newspapers and government understood that being a supporter of football is intrinsically an act of micro-nationalism. International football then magnifies this micro-nationalism on the grand stage of the World Cup qualifying matches. Finally, football is centered on the ideas of deprivation and frustration, which propaganda can easily fuel for a national cause. Unlike in American sports, where points are generally scored at a frenetic pace, football is based on denial and thus acts as a microcosm of dispossession and denial.  Considering the territorial disputes between Honduras and El Salvador and the denial and depravity of adequate land from Salvadorans, it is easy to recognize how the propaganda campaigns gained traction so easily in neighboring countries.\nThe media campaign can be traced all the way back to the Honduran farmers. Thousands of Salvadorans moved from El Salvador, their homeland, into the neighboring territory of Honduras for the temptation of deeply discounted land. In 1966, with hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans living in Honduras, the most prominent Honduran land owners–enraged at this rapid Salvadoran influx–formed the National Federation of Farmers and Livestock-Farmers of Honduras. These farmers were intent on protecting their own interests and land for exclusive Honduran use and were able to receive government backing.\nThe National Federation of Farmers successfully pressured the government of President Oswaldo López Arellano, who had seized power through military coup, to deploy a government-sponsored propaganda campaign whose goal was to advance the farmers’ cause. As an unexpected byproduct, the campaign heightened general Honduran nationalism among the population. Hondurans, overcome with national pride, began indiscriminately attacking Salvadoran immigrants. As the situation deteriorated, these initial acts of violence escalated to alleged beatings, torture, and lynchings reported in local newspapers.\nSalvadoran F-51 Mustang\nAttempts to mollify the issue of immigration through agreements and reforms were met with contempt and mounting tension, exacerbated by the adoption of a new Honduran agrarian reform law in 1969 that deprived El Salvadoran campesinos of their farms and livelihoods. The agrarian reform law had been avoided up to that point because of Honduras’ “capacity to absorb El Salvador’s surplus” population.[17] The legislation compelled the seizure of land from Salvadoran immigrants and reallocated it among native-born Hondurans, further enraging the Salvadoran citizens and government.\nAnother component of the propaganda campaign was graffiti. Graffiti is, in many ways, the greatest social commentary and serves as a derivative of the media, revealing the depth of national pride. The wonderful element of graffiti is that it is a civilian-owned activity.  Regardless of police surveillance or draconian law decrees, citizens will always find a way of expressing themselves through graffiti, for the government cannot patrol and detain every single person or group in every location of either nation at every time of the day. Further, as long as graffiti is visible to even one other person, the message will have been conveyed successfully, as a trickling domino effect often ensues. Graffiti is almost always used to express or suggest messages for which no one would pointedly take ownership.  That is the beauty of graffiti; it is an anonymous catalyst for change, and is a perfect conduit to swell national pride.  If one considers the startling reality that, on both sides of the border, citizens of each country were often rounded up and put into national stadia which served as prison camps, it is easy to imagine how graffiti can muster a crowd into action and, ultimately, marshal troops to war.\nHonduras and El Salvador were certainly not the only countries involved in the virulent propaganda campaigns.  In his message to the nation, President Sanchez charged that Honduras “had incited the Salvadoran people to insurrection, with the cooperation of the radio of the Cuban Government.”[18] The Honduran radio attacked the “14 families” of El Salvador alleged to control most of his [President Sanchez’s] nation’s limited wealth, and Radio Havana has taken up the attack on the “oligarchy” of Honduras.  Hence, even the Cuban media intervened in the Football War, siding with El Salvador against the Honduran radio.\nHowever, it is important to note that coffee, the backbone of El Salvador’s economy, has always been in the hands of El Salvador’s richest families, the “Fourteen”.  They also owned most of the factories that sprang up during the past decade of industrial growth.  Few of the benefits of this economic development trickled down to the mass population of 3.5 million, but the hierarchy had historically been structured this way and any sociopolitical shift would have been unprecedented.  Radio Havana took advantage of a long-standing, stagnant situation that had been historically resistant to change in an attempt to provoke demonstrations.\n“To add to the explosive brew, rich Honduran landowners used the Salvadoran immigrants as an easy target, scapegoating them as the villains whenever the landowners were challenged about the great imbalance of land ownership in Honduras.”[19] As a result, “Honduras began to expel large numbers of Salvadorans. The Salvadoran press seized this and created a fury about the mistreatment of Salvadorans by the Hondurans.”[20]\nWhile both nations developed official policies in response to the crisis, the nations’ government-backed media campaigns pitted themselves against one another.  By 1968, a Honduran propaganda campaign was set on limiting the consumption of other Central American commodities in order to bolster national production.  The following message appeared in late 1968[21]:\nAlain Rouquié and Michel Vale, trans.., “HONDURAS-EL SALVADOR, THE WAR OF ONE HUNDRED HOURS: A CASE OF REGIONAL DISINTEGRATION,” International Journal of Politics 3.3 (1973), Historical Abstracts, 17.\nBy June 1969, the tone of the propaganda became overtly anti-Salvadoran[22]:\nAlain Rouquié and Michel Vale, trans.., “HONDURAS-EL SALVADOR, THE WAR OF ONE HUNDRED HOURS: A CASE OF REGIONAL DISINTEGRATION,” International Journal of Politics 3.3 (1973), Historical Abstracts, 19.\nThrough the implementation of  these restrictive trade policies, both nations gradually wound one another in a tight bind. These national policies deteriorated into propaganda campaigns, and the solution to the regional crisis was found in even more widespread press campaigns. In Honduras, the anti-Salvadoran program mollified mass aggressiveness by funneling it towards the enemy. These campaigns were at first permitted and then openly encouraged by the governments. Both nations were waiting for the straw to break the camel’s back so that a negligible event could be blown out of proportion and incite emotions in ways previously unimaginable. The Salvadoran mass media took advantage of anti-Salvadoran skirmishes that occurred in Honduras to aggravate the mood of soccer fanatics back in El Salvador and exploit those emotions into tangible action. Nor was the timing of this new approach coincidental; a soccer game between the two nations was scheduled to be played  on June 8 in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.\nAt the time, television sets were rare in most Central American countries; almost all found their news through daily newspapers. As a result, the written word “takes on a kind of sacred character”[23] of truth since much of the population was not well educated. Teams of the two fragile nations first met for a best-of-three-game series on the field in Tegucigalpa, Honduras on June 8, 1969 for the World Cup eliminations. The Salvadoran team was serenaded endlessly by the crowd during their stay in Tegucigalpa. El Salvador, which lost by a score of 1-0 in extra time, felt cheated, with the loss a burnishment of  “national honor.”[24] When the Honduran team revisited San Salvador for a return match, tensions were came to the fore as riots erupted downtown, claiming San Salvadoran casualties.\nThe goal of the match was clear: “to create conditions for revenge on the Honduran soccer players”[25] and their entourage at the match in San Salvador just a few days later on June 15.  Although this goal was not advertised, it nonetheless had the triumphant effect of stimulating anti-Honduran sentiment within El Salvador.  When the Salvadorans returned to their homeland, they both expanded and served the underhanded purposes of their government, in whom their allegiance was placed.  “The many details of the humiliations suffered by the Salvadorans in Honduras served to intensify anew national animosity, involving even more the masses in a national unity directed against Honduras.  The idea of a primitive war against those perpetrating genocide was already falling on fertile ground.”[26] Salvadoran President Fidel Sanchez Hernandez angrily criticized the acts of violence against Honduran citizens and blamed “communist and subversive elements.”[27] Honduras retaliated with bravado by circulating unsubstantiated print media claiming Honduran prisoners in San Salvador, triggering a rash of attacks in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula and provoking another wave of refugees back into El Salvador.\nThe aftermath of the second football match was a large concentration of Salvadorans frantically fleeing Honduras as the Honduran press blew negligible incidents out of proportion, “alleging maltreatment and property confiscation”[28] and triggering the crisis on June 15, 1969.  The Honduran press and radio launched a “virulent anti-Salvadoran campaign” that contributed to the previously mentioned agrarian reform program that granted government land allocation only to “Hondurans by birth.”[29]\nTwo days before this second match, Honduras sealed its borders against the flow of Salvadorans, and by natural response, on June 26 El Salvador ended all diplomatic relations with Honduras.  On the same day, El Salvador commenced a diplomatic campaign with the Organization of American States and in the U.N. aimed not at “resolving the conflict peacefully but at demonstrating that Honduras was violating human rights, was committing the crime of genocide, and was attacking the borders of El Salvador with military skirmishes and aerial attacks.”[30] Naturally, international relations became insolvent as demonstrations continued to be held and border skirmishes intensified amid these bold accusations.\nThe diplomatic actions of the Salvadoran government suggest that El Salvador intended to pursue a peaceful resolution of the conflict.  Rather, the El Salvadoran government used the international diplomatic forum for justification of armed aggression.  As a result, on July 3, the war was looming. The Salvadoran army had purposefully organized a border incident in El Poy, branded Honduras as the aggressor, and “succeeded in giving more power to the masses,” an act that was deemed unprecedented.\nBack to the Top\nResults of the Propaganda Campaigns\nThus the propaganda campaigns transcended simple messages and local newspaper articles in compelling citizens into action. Propaganda led to drastic changes in domestic policy, as demonstrated by the Honduran agrarian reform act of 1969 in response to the heavy influx of Salvadorans. Propaganda provoked the strategic bombing of pivotal petroleum refineries in El Salvador; it justified repressive military control measures; it obscured the problem of population growth. It led to the installation, by the OAS, of a force of military observers to patrol the common border.\nPropaganda regimes generated the real cause of the war, political nationalism, and both governments fueled the fire until, diplomatically, the situation spun out of control. Propaganda caused El Salvador’s army to invade Honduras to “save” victimized Salvadoran immigrants from “atrocities,” as the newspapers and leaders reported.  In many ways, propaganda acted as the most fundamental catalyst for the war itself. The Football War is the only one of its kind, but its origins and ramifications are common to many other historical conflicts.\nThe campaigns, particularly those of El Salvador, were brilliant in the sense that the press was only one factor in arousing animosity. Other tools were used in the global environment to catapult animosity into measurable action and diplomacy. One of these tools was the ability to influence the OAS, which was already being harshly criticized for its lack of mediation in the crisis. El Salvador created conditions of revenge by exploiting the game held in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, but this was relatively easy since the San Salvadoran masses were easily impressionable and ready to strike, based on past occurrences, regardless of the match results. Even if El Salvador had won, the pieces of the puzzle were already in place for rioting when the Honduran team arrived in San Salvador.\nFurthermore, the fact that El Salvador never favored peaceful conflict resolution suggests that the government was pleased with the direction of its propaganda campaigns. The Salvadoran government’s next step was to manipulate the OAS as a pawn to rationalize armed aggression against Honduras. Even the Honduran chancellor protested the events to his Salvadoran counterpart, citing that the “mental and physical well-being of the National Football Team of Honduras”[31] was being compromised. Only after this calculated protest did the OAS casually launched an investigation, calling for the Subcommittee on Human Rights to visit Honduras and verify the alleged brutal aggressions, profound offenses, and serious crimes to which the propaganda alluded. El Salvador never even favored peace settlements in the first place. El Salvador was content with its position of labeling Honduras as the aggressor because such an accusation would eventually bring in the OAS, however dilatory the OAS may be.\nUltimately, the reason that the propaganda campaigns were so effectivw in Honduras and El Salvador is that the accusations trickled downward from a central source, the leader of the nation, rather than from a disparate group of local media outlets. This allowed the propaganda to be uniform and consistent, rather than conflicting. Centralization of power also allowed for  effective propaganda because the president was also the general of the national armies, allowing the rapid spread of information through the ranks, down to the lowest foot soldier.\nThe Salvadoran Council of Ministers was the organization that charged the crime of genocide against Honduras, not some obscure, regional, and unregulated newspaper. Salvadoran President Fidel Sanchez Hernandez was the one who blamed any acts of violence on “communist and subversive elements.”[32] The leaders were the ones who made the accusations all the more believable, since the citizens believed that they could put their trust in the government. In both Honduras and El Salvador, as in many other Latin American countries, the presidents functioned as both politicians and generals, leading their armies into battle. This dramatically changed the dynamics of perceptions in Latin America.\nBack to the Top\nInfluence of the OAS\nThe Organization of American States (OAS) was an international organization, created on Apr. 30, 1948, at Bogotá, Colombia, by agreement of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Another 17 states have subsequently joined. The OAS is a regional agency designed to work with the United Nations to promote peace, justice, and hemispheric solidarity. One of its primary goals is to cultivate economic development, especially during the 1960s; it was an “Alliance for Progress” meant to “defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the signatory nations.” Yet the OAS did not effectively mediate the Football War. Nor did the U.S. State Department take active steps to resolve the conflict: “The U.S. State Department did not plan to intervene unilaterally in the dispute,” according to State Department spokesperson Robert McClosley.\nThe United States’ desire to stay discreetly in the background during the crisis and “operate within the framework of the regional organization”[33] stemmed from a desire to improve its image in the eyes of the OAS. After years of interventionist policy, the U.S. sought to appease its hemispheric partners and allow the OAS to coordinate any response to the turmoil. It is worth noting that, given the U.S.’ desire to stay out of the conflict, it was unlikely that the OAS would take action. According to Latin America expert William M. LeoGrande and defense expert Carla Anne Robbins, “the United States’ domination of the OAS is so complete that the regional organization acts only when the political or strategic interests of North America are involved.”[34] The OAS was reluctant to forcefully intervene to prevent the conflict from escalating, and the U.S. “never moved from a position of extreme caution, preferring to remain on the periphery of the conflict”[35] to protect its own self-interests, which were arguably never in any real danger.\nUS Response to the Football War: Avoid It!\nBack to the Top\nPolitical Unrest and Ongoing Disputes: 1969-Present\nDespite its relatively short, 100-hour duration, the Soccer War was by no means an isolated conflict that was quickly resolved and then largely forgotten. Its influence continues to resonate in both Honduras and El Salvador today, and its legacy has even been felt in recent World Cup soccer qualifying matches. When it quickly became clear in July 1969 that Honduras and El Salvador were not going to end the war on their own, the Organization of American States (OAS) met in Washington to discuss the forced evacuation of El Salvador from Honduras. The OAS arranged a cease-fire that took effect on July 20, 1969. After identifying El Salvador as the aggressor, the OAS decided to impose “upon it [El Salvador] diplomatic and economic sanctions.”[36] At this point, casualties on both sides were already greater than 2,000.[37] Diplomatically, the OAS sanctions marked the official end of the conflict. However, both countries continued to feel the implications of the war long after the ceasefire was arranged. The Central American Common Market was suspended for twenty-two years, trade was disrupted, and vigorous propaganda still circulated in both El Salvador and Honduras. Honduras later seceded from the Central American economic union.  It then decided to reestablish importation taxes on products from Common Market countries and sign bilateral commercial treaties[38] without concern for the rules of the economic community. Consequently, Honduras remains one of Latin America’s poorest countries today.\nOAS Emblem\nHonduras’s inability or unwillingness to integrate into the Central American Common Market served mainly to strengthen the “existing [political] order.”[39] Most recently, on June 28, 2009, the Honduran army ousted leftist President Manuel Zelaya from power after months of mounting tensions surround his attempts to “lift presidential term limits.”[40] The coup marked the first successful “military takeover of a Central American government in 16 years.”[41] In the days leading up to June 28, Zelaya had been advocating a referendum regarding the rewriting of the constitution, and one of his eventual goals was probably to extend his presidential term.  He ignored the Administrative Law Tribunal’s injunction against holding the referendum, and consequently, the Honduran Supreme Court issued a secret order for his detention.  Early in the morning of June 28, soldiers arrived at Zelaya’s home in Tegucigalpa, disarmed the presidential guard, and roused Zelaya from his bed.  He was then promptly flown to exile in Costa Rica at gunpoint and sustained no injuries.  Zelaya quickly contacted media in San José and referred to the event as a kidnapping, and refused to recognize anyone named president in his stead. His close friend Hugo Chávez, President of Venezuela, vowed to consider the coup “an ‘act of war’ if there were hostilities against his diplomats.”[42] Colonel Inestroza, chief lawyer in the military, later admitted that Zelaya’s deportation did in fact violate the court order, which only gave permission for the president’s removal from office.  However, Inestroza justified the military’s actions by asserting that Zelaya was removed from the country strictly to prevent violence and bloodshed.  After accepting Zelaya’s supposed letter of resignation, the National Congress quickly named Roberto Micheletti, a congressional leader and member of Zelaya’s political party, as his successor and called the coup “a democratic act.”[43] The United States government, the United Nations, the Organization of American States, and every other country in Latin America have refused to recognize Micheletti as President, condemning Zelaya’s removal as a coup. The international community placed a lot of pressure on Honduras to resolve the issue. Zelaya denied resigning and made two unsuccessful open attempts to return to Honduras before eventually returning clandestinely and seeking asylum in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa.  While in Costa Rica, he stated, “I want to return to my country.  I am president of Honduras.”[44] Micheletti’s government was characterized by multiple violations of human rights such as habeas corpus and freedom of association, as well as by rigid restrictions placed on the press.  On Sunday, November 29, Honduras held presidential, parliamentary, and local elections, monitored by more than 30,000 soldiers, police, and reservists.  Both Zelaya and Micheletti were ineligible to run, and ltimately, Porfirio Lobo Sosa, candidate for the National Party, won the presidency with 56% of the vote.  Elvin Santos, the candidate from Zelaya’s and Micheletti’s Liberal Party, was second with 38%. However, the coup d’état that occurred in June undermined the legitimacy of this election, with many organizations and individuals, both within Honduras and internationally. Most nations and international bodies refused to recognize the elections held under Micheletti.\nFormer Leftist President Zelaya\nIn El Salvador, the Soccer War “obscured the problem of population growth and was used to justify militarily repressive control measures.”[45] The government used the National Democratic Organization (Orden), a “peasant organization”[46] established in the early 1960s, to coercively control the nation and protect the interests of the landed oligarchy.  By the late 1970s, Orden had about 100,000 members and “functioned as a paramilitary adjunct and an important part of the rural intelligence network for the security forces.”[47] Elections were frequently marred by fraud and corruption.  However, the military was soon confronted with a new phenomenon: left-wing terrorism. During the mid-1970s, radical leftist groups began to gain widespread support, and many popular organizations began to mobilize the masses “behind a revolutionary program of radical reform.”[48] Most of these organizations were run by guerrilla groups and drew their leadership from Christian Base Communities, a group of radical Roman Catholic revolutionary organizations.  The largest was the Revolutionary Popular Bloc, which boasted a membership of approximately 60,000.[49] Some of the most extreme groups kidnapped government officials and held them for ransom and attacked government buildings in San Salvador. Finally, civil war broke out in 1980 between the government and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), a coalition of five left-wing militias. The United States backed the right wing military government, while Cuba and the Soviet Union threw their support to the Marxist-Leninist rebels. El Salvador’s infrastructure quickly collapsed, and thousands fled, hoping to find sanctuary in Honduras.  However, complicating matters was the presence of a large number of Nicaraguan refugees in Honduras, who had fled the Sandinista Revolution in 1979. “Border skirmishes flared again” between Honduras and El Salvador in May 1980, when the Honduran military killed more than 500 refugees attempting “to cross the border region of the Sumpul River.”[50] It remains unclear whether or not the Honduran border patrol or the Salvadoran military fired first, but regardless, diplomatic relations between the two nations became even more complicated.  The countries eventually signed a peace treaty on October 30, 1980, “agreeing to continue negotiations on the final demarcation of the border.”[51] However, it would be an additional twelve years until the World Court finally resolved the border disputes, dividing territory between El Salvador and Honduras. In El Salvador, civil war and unrest dragged on for more than a decade. The Chapultepec Peace Accords were finally signed in Chapultepec, Mexico in 1992, creating a new Constitution, regulating the armed forces, establishing a civilian police force, and transforming the FMLN from a guerrilla army to a political party.  The United Nations monitored the peace process until 1997.\nBack to the Top\nThe Lingering Legacy of the Soccer War\nRecently, some echoes of the Soccer War emerged during the 2010 World Cup qualifying matches between Honduras and the United States, as well as those between Honduras and El Salvador. On October 10, 2009, the United States and Honduras met in a qualifier under domestic conditions similar to those in 1969: political upheaval, demonstrations, factions, and militaristic rule in Honduras setting that country’s direction. The game was to occur “smack dab in the middle of an ongoing political crisis in Honduras,”[52] while the OAS sent delegations in an attempt to peacefully relieve the tension. An article in Americas Quarterly published before the match speculated that “anyone seeking to stir things up in Honduras—from within or without—might well attempt to use the passions surrounding the game as a way to provoke an over-reaction by the security forces,”[53] which would cause Micheletti’s government to face intense international scrutiny. The article also proposed that a Honduran victory could also “increase national pride, which might well be transferred to [Micheletti’s] de facto government.”[54] Despite the intense political climate surrounding the qualifying matches, politics were not allowed to interfere, and the games were played as planned. Both teams were determined to make it to South Africa and were unwilling to let political struggles impede their chances. Many Hondurans looked forward to the game simply because they wanted to cheer for the same side and be unified, even just briefly, “in the midst of the worst political crisis that Central America has faced in decades.”[55] The game would give people a break from protests and curfews, a 90-minute respite from politics. Before leaving Florida, United States coach Bob Bradley briefed the players on the political situation– the team was greeted by military forces upon their arrival, and had to tread carefully given the political upheaval. Ultimately, the United States won 3-2 in an exciting match, and Honduran fans, though disappointed, were generally respectful and applauded the win.  During the match, Honduras took the lead with a goal in the 47th minute, but the United States eventually answered with three goals. This victory guaranteed the U.S. a trip to South Africa for the 2010 World Cup, while Honduras was left to continue vying for a spot.[56]\nSoon after the U.S.-Honduras game, another match also brought to mind some lingering memories of the Soccer War. On October 14, 2009, El Salvador and Honduras met in a qualifying round for the CONCACAF region. The 1969 qualifying matches between the two countries had provoked the outbreak of war, but thankfully peace had prevailed for the forty years since. Honduras won the match 1-0, securing the last automatic World Cup qualifying spot in the CONCACAF region (after the Costa Rica-U.S. game ended in a draw). 2010 marked Honduras’s second-ever World Cup appearance and first since 1982. The victory over El Salvador marked El Salvador’s first-ever home loss during the qualifying rounds.  After defeating El Salvador, “Honduras’s players erupted in emotional celebration.”[57] Honduran coach Reinaldo Rueda said after the match that “his team’s achievement was a success for the whole country and the ‘happiness of the people.’”[58] Unfortunately, politics ultimately tainted this euphoria, as both Micheletti’s de facto government and Zelaya’s ousted government tried to use the soccer team’s victory to their advantage to gain political support. In a show of support for the former president, Amado Guevara, captain of the Honduran team, gave Manuel Zelaya a signed jersey after the win. Despite its political ramifications, the 2010 victory over El Salvador was an exciting end to a successful string of qualifying matches.\nMembers of the Honduran national team before the championship match against the U.S. in the 2008 CONCACAF Men’s Olympic Qualification soccer tournament on March 23, 2008\nMexican journalist Luis Suarez states that, in Latin America, the “border between soccer and politics is vague. There is a long list of governments that have fallen or been overthrown after the defeat of the national team. Players on the losing team are denounced in the press as traitors.” [59] There is no better example of this phenomenon than the Soccer War, in which sport was, if not the main cause of the underlying tensions, the catalyst for armed conflict. Moreover, while this war was localized, regional, and concentrated, it was nonetheless brutal. Fifty thousand citizens of both countries lost their homes and farms was a result of the six-day war. But most unsettling, perhaps, is not the capacity of soccer to affect politics, but rather the suspicious motives of political leaders that also helped push the nations to war. Polish Journalist Ryszard Kapuscinski laments bluntly: “Both governments are satisfied: for several days Honduras and El Salvador occupied the front pages of the world press and were the object of interest and concern. The only chance small countries from the Third World have of evoking a lively international interest is when they decide to shed blood.”[61] This outlook and willingness to sacrifice life for temporary international attention are undoubtedly far graver aspects of the conflict than its soccer catalyst. Despite the many weighty causes of the Soccer War–the border disputes, the trade (dis)agreements, as well as the confrontation’s role in international politics–the conflict is named after the sport.  Soccer was not the biggest underlying cause of the conflict, but it was the impetus that elicited fierce–and violent–passions on both side of the border. Thus, in examining the relationship between sport and politics, we must not forget that sport can play a pivotal role in influencing world events.\nHow to cite this article: Lindsey Barrett, Colby Leachman, Claire Lockerby, Steven McMullen, Matthew Schorr, Yuriy Veytskin, “The Soccer War,” at Soccer Politics Pages, http://sites.duke.edu/wcwp (accessed on (date)).\nBack to the Top\n[1] Cable, Vincent.  “The ‘Football War’ and the Central American Common Market.” International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 1944—), Vol. 45, No. 4 (Oct., 1969), 662.\n[2] Galeano, Eduardo.

We are currently working on a history project for the National History Day and we were wondering if it would be possible to have an interview with you as it seems that you did a great job at the details of the soccer war. We think that your contribution would help us greatly.\nReply ↓\noggs\nOctober 17, 2018\nthis is bollox\nThe football war as far as i’m concerned is going on right now, it’s the tussle between the terminologies for the game ie the name,,,, football or soccer\nPeople say that it’s only a name, but already Americas blasphmous retort has spread to japan and Australia and Canada, as well in the Skysports have recently struck up a deal with the NFL as has Tottenham Hotspur Football club, to host NNFL games, there are also increasing number of Football related shows , which are using that disgusting expression “soccer” as part of the name, And now i’m hearing that sky are wanting a new franchise team to represent the UK in the NFL proper, which iv’e heard will be recognised within 5-6 years…..now i ask what’s going to happen to the name when the American sport also uses the same name even though the object they use isn’t even round and the game isn’t played predominately with the feet as is the case with proper football…where is this all going to lead to?…….many people couldn’t care less what it’s called, and will be easily converted, sky only care about their wallets, i mean why would they care?…….but i fear for the identity of the beautiful game, dark forces are at work trying to decieve the public, but some of us will not go down without one enormous fight……..so go on yanky punks take yer best shot, because we will be ready..\nReply ↓\nJim M.\nApril 25, 2024\n4/25/2024, Thursday\nI did not find anything related to Costa Rica President, Dr. Oscar Arias Sanchez, and his miraculous and genius summoning of several regional waring country’s Presidents to a meeting, during the 1980s, where they all readily attended. This led to a solid Peace Agreement (notably including democratic civil voting rights) very soon after that meeting.\nThis occured during the U.S. President Ronald Reagan era when the “Iran-Contra” affair was going strong in world news.\nWas this event born out of an official’s bad call in a soccer game or a continuation of the 1969 smaller regional conflict that maybe grew?\nDr. Oscar Arias was awarded with the Nobel Peace Prize for his intense work and expertise with negotiating the Peace Settlement.\nI had a remarkable conversation with him after a speech he gave at Kent State in 1994. Dr. Arias was a decisively determined and brave person, who certainly knew the power and satisfaction of… simply making some phone calls!\nJim.

While these measures hardly did much to alleviate institutionalised misery, they were still too abominable a departure from business as usual for the right-wing Honduran elite – faithful acolytes of American empire and replicators of capitalist oppression.\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\nlist of 4 items\nlist 1 of 4\nA world of regions\nlist 2 of 4\nScientific racism, militarism, and the new atheists\nlist 3 of 4\nElon Musk is a global problem\nlist 4 of 4\nWhy the US is engineering political change in East Africa\nend of list\nFollowing Zelaya’s overthrow, the Barack Obama administration in the United States took its sweet time debating whether the coup had actually been a coup and should therefore trigger the required cutoffs in aid to Honduras.\nUltimately, the US heel-dragging allowed the Honduran right wing to re-entrench itself in power, and subsequent illegitimate and fraudulent elections – swiftly signed off on by Obama & Co – sealed the deal.\nWhen the coup transpired, I was in Argentina visiting my parents, who had recently relocated there from the US homeland. I had just spent four months hitchhiking through Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela – a trip that, like my previous international hitchhiking jaunts, had offered me a first-hand glimpse of my country’s malevolent machinations worldwide.\nI had seen, for example, the rubble of Lebanon in summer of 2006 – when the US had rush-shipped bombs to the Israeli military to assist in apocalyptic destruction – and the rubble of a Colombian society decimated in part by massive US funding for Colombian security forces with a penchant for massacring civilians. The takeaway from my travels was clear: civil rights movement leader Martin Luther King, Jr had been dead right when he called the US government “the greatest purveyor of violence in the world”.\nAdvertisement\nOn the subject of Honduras, however, I was still woefully clueless – to the extent that, watching the news of the coup on Argentinian television on June 28, I thought the country was an island.\nExactly one month later, I was on a flight from Buenos Aires to the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, having bought a ticket on a whim. Naturally, it was infinitely easier for a US citizen to enter Honduras with no other excuse than that she was bored in Argentina than for a Honduran to enter the US for more existential, life-threatening reasons – many of them resulting from US violations of Honduran sovereignty in the first place.\nIndeed, the US bears no small part of the blame for the obscene levels of violence in Honduras, which became even more obscene in the aftermath of the coup and led to the country’s stint as the murder capital of the world. It is no accident that the inaugural 2018 US-bound migrant caravan originated in Honduras.\nDuring the Cold War, the Central American nation had been dubbed the “USS Honduras” in light of its central role in the Contra war against neighbouring Nicaragua, which had aimed to terrorise Nicaraguans out of their leftist inclinations.\nSign up for Al Jazeera\nAmericas Coverage Newsletter\nUS politics, Canada’s multiculturalism, South America’s geopolitical rise—we bring you the stories that matter.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\nprotected by reCAPTCHA\nThe US also had plenty of terror tricks up its sleeve in Honduras itself, and, throughout the 1980s, a CIA-trained military unit called Battalion 316 tortured and otherwise antagonised Hondurans suspected of opposition to capitalism.\nIn 1995, the Baltimore Sun interviewed a former battalion member who “recalled how he nearly suffocated people with rubber masks, how he attached wires to their genitals and shocked them with electricity, how he tore off a man’s testicles with a rope”.\nAnyway, what is not to like about capitalism?\nIn the contemporary era, meanwhile, US contributions to violence in Honduras have ranged from your typical neoliberal devastation of lives and livelihoods to vast financial contributions to homicidal state security forces operating with near-total impunity.\nWhen I arrived in Tegucigalpa in July 2009 for what would turn into a four-month stay, daily and overwhelmingly peaceful anti-coup protests were being met with ludicrous displays of force by the coup regime. On one occasion, I watched as elderly Honduran ladies were dutifully blasted by water cannon loaded with pepper spray.\nOn another, I attended the burial of Jairo Sánchez, a union leader shot in the face by police – one of the countless Hondurans killed, disappeared, maimed, raped, and abused as part of the valiant effort to ensure that the USS Honduras retained its prized spot as a key node of empire.\nAdvertisement\nOf course, my US passport and the fact that I could remove myself from Honduras at will meant that I could not even remotely experience the institutionalised violence perpetually bearing down on Hondurans. I can nonetheless definitively say that, in the 70 or so countries I have travelled in, I have never felt so acute a lack of personal security as in Honduras.\nThere was the time I awoke in the middle of the night to find a man in my room – on what sort of mission I will never know, as my bloodcurdling screams caused him to dive back out the window, leaving me to never sleep again. There was the time I was accosted while jogging and relieved of five dollars and a dilapidated alarm clock, although my accoster quickly decided I could keep the clock. And then there was the time I was accosted and threatened with death-by-shooting if I did not hand over something of value.\nIn this last case, I suggested to the man that we walk to the nearest ATM, which fortuitously ended up being quite far and thus gave me time to ponder what to do about my lack of an ATM card. Even more fortuitously, my companion and I got to chatting (“So, what do you do when you are not assaulting people?”), and he eventually pronounced me not half-bad and not in need of mugging. As a bonus, he gave me the option of adopting his 18-month-old son on account of the child’s mother’s crack cocaine habit.\nWhile I did not take him up on the adoption offer, I did see his sudden kindness as a form of human resilience in the face of a brutal economic system that blames poor and desperate individuals for their own brutalisation. And yet the US-backed capitalist arrangement in Honduras and beyond ensures the production of these very “criminals” by denying populations basic rights like healthcare and shelter – because, obviously, human rights interfere with profit.\nSome months into my stay in Tegucigalpa, I finagled a rare interview with Romeo Vásquez, the Honduran general who had spearheaded the coup and an alumnus of the US-run School of the Americas – a longtime go-to institution for Latin American dictators and death squad leaders.\nIn addition to charmingly remarking that he was not at all opposed to taking a second wife, Vásquez unleashed intriguing soundbites such as that the “goal of the military at the moment is the protection of life” and that “human life is the priority of the state”.\nNow, as the Honduran coup turns 12, human life is no more a priority than it was then – neither for Honduras, nor the US, which continues to fuel right-wing abuses by the Central American nation and across the world. And as my own writing career also turns 12, there is no dearth of things to write about.\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.\nAbout\nShow more\nConnect\nShow more\nOur Channels\nShow more\nOur Network\nShow more\nFollow Al Jazeera English:\nfacebook\ntwitter\nyoutube\ninstagram-colored-outline\nrss\n© 2025 Al Jazeera Media Network\nYou rely on Al Jazeera for truth and transparency\nWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver and personalize content and ads, enable features, measure site performance, and enable social media sharing.

The reverberations of the coup extend into present-day Honduras, which continues to struggle to maintain its political sovereignty.\nFor the past seven decades, interference by the United States government has seriously compromised Honduras’ political sovereignty. The United States engineered coups in Haiti (1991 and 2004) and Bolivia (2019) as well as set in motion a long-term – failed – coup process against Venezuela beginning in 1999.\n  Colectivo Culturas Vivas, Salgamos a jugar / Let’s go play, Honduras, 2020\n  Why was President Zelaya overthrown? Nothing in his personal history as the son of a rancher, a businessman, and the manager of the Honduran Council of Private Enterprise (Consejo Hondureño de la Empresa Privada, COHEP) or in the history of his party, the Liberal Party of Honduras (Partido Liberal de Honduras, PLH), suggested either his radicalisation or that he would be the victim of a coup. Elected in 2006, Zelaya saw the merit of a broad reform agenda.\nGreat disparities and social infirmities in Honduras held back social progress for the people of Honduras, for which reason Zelaya’s government introduced free public education for children, a higher minimum wage, and a range of social welfare policies, including cash transfers and free electricity. It is by now well-acknowledged that social indignities cannot be overcome if the rights of women are set aside, so Zelaya vetoed a decree that sought to ban emergency contraception pills (a measure overturned immediately by the coup regime). As a consequence of the actions of Zelaya’s administration, absolute poverty was reduced in Honduras.\nIn 2009, Berta Cáceres Flores, a leader and co-founder of the Council of Popular and Indigenous Organisations of Honduras (COPINH), reflected on why this coup took place:\nBecause of the rich, the oligarchs, [and] the far right – with support from the mafia of Miami [and] the Cuban and Venezuelan counter-revolution – these are the consultants of these coup supporters. Their worry is that the Honduran people could decide what to do with strategic resources like water, the forests, the land, our sovereignty, with our labour rights, the minimum wage, women’s rights, constitutional rights, the self determination of the Indigenous and Black people. So many things that we, as Honduran people, dream of, the possibility of having an inclusive, democratic, equitable state and society with direct participation of the people. The coup-supporting oligarchs know all of this. That is why there was a coup. And this coup is against all of the processes of liberation of our continent.\nTo advance the agenda of reform further, Zelaya affiliated his country with the ALBA’s (the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America) process of regional integration and with PetroCaribe, a social democratic oil agreement that provides low-cost Venezuelan oil to the region. Up to this point, Honduras’ fuel industry had been surrendered to the major oil giants. Zelaya sought to change this relationship by subjecting the fuel industry to an international bidding process, which enabled Honduras to gain $200 million from Esso, Shell, and Texaco. Due to Honduras’ affiliation with ALBA, ties with Cuba increased. About 480 Cuban doctors had already been in the country since Hurricane Mitch in 1998. By 2009, hundreds of Hondurans had graduated from the Latin American School of Medicine (ELAM) in Cuba and worked to build the public health institution. Some, like Dr. Luther Castillo, a member of the Garifuna community, served under Zelaya as vice-minister of cooperation with ALBA.\nThe domestic reforms angered the oligarchy, while the linkage to the ALBA process angered Washington, DC. US Ambassador Charles Ford described Zelaya unkindly as ‘almost a caricature of a landowner and caudillo in terms of his leadership style and tone’. Ford accused Zelaya of being beholden to ‘powerful, unnamed interests’. Zelaya’s days were numbered.\nZelaya proposed the formation of a National Constituent Assembly to revise the 1982 Constitution, which had been written in the aftermath of a long period of the military dictatorship from 1955 to 1982 to defend the interests of US firms such as United Fruit (the US Ambassador in Tegucigalpa was known colloquially as the ‘pro-consul’). People’s movements backed the idea, while the oligarchy and the US government opposed it on the grounds that a new constitution might deepen the process of social reform in Honduras.\nFor the November 2009 elections, Zelaya proposed that, in addition to voting for a new president, congress, and municipal officials, the electorate also vote for a National Constituent Assembly in a fourth ballot. However, he wanted to leave the question of whether or not there should be a fourth ballot to the Honduran people; in March 2009, he proposed that the public vote in a referendum on 28 June 2009. A dirty tricks campaign run by the opposition began to suggest that Zelaya wanted to extend his term of office, although he told El País in June 2009 that he planned to leave office when his term ended in January 2010. On the same day that the people of Honduras were set to vote in the referendum, the military arrested Zelaya and dismissed his cabinet.\nThe United Nations General Assembly condemned the coup, and so did US President Barack Obama (although Obama’s secretary of state Hillary Clinton contradicted him immediately). The US role in the coup requires some explanation. On the surface, the US government, including US Ambassador to Honduras Hugo Llorens, said in public that, while the US opposed the direction Zelaya had taken, they were opposed to a coup against the 1982 Constitution. Meanwhile, beneath the surface, the US military, represented by US Military Group commander in Honduras Colonel Kenneth Rodriguez, was in direct contact with the head of the Honduran military General Romero Vásquez Velásquez right through the coup. Vásquez was trained at the School of the Americas in Fort Benning, Georgia in 1976 and 1984.\nIn leaked emails, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made the case against following the Organisation of American States (OAS) process, through which Zelaya’s ALBA allies could have driven the agenda and likely could have restored him to office. Instead, Clinton successfully put pressure for the negotiations between the coup regime and Zelaya’s government to take place in San José, Costa Rica under the watchful eye of US ally Costa Rican president Óscar Arias. The end result of the Clinton process was to legitimise the coup. It was clear that the US wanted the policies pushed by Zelaya nullified, and the Honduran military chiefs – close to the US officials – concurred.\nThere is nothing new about US military intervention in the country. In the 1980s, Honduras was used as a launching pad for US-backed wars of destabilisation against the people of El Salvador and Nicaragua. In the same period, the US took charge of the Soto Cano (Palmerola) Air Base outside of Tegucigalpa for its own purposes, including to carry out the dirty wars inflicted on El Salvador and Nicaragua. Decades later, Zelaya wanted to turn that base into a commercial airport, which the US government opposed. In 2008, US Ambassador Charles Ford wrote that the US needed to maintain a ‘low public profile’ while working to ‘protect US security interests at Soto Cano’.\nAfter Ford left his post as Ambassador, he went to work at US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), the US combat command for Latin America and the Caribbean. When Zelaya was arrested, he was brought to Soto Cano. US soldiers manned the control tower, which gave permission to the aircraft that took Zelaya into exile in Costa Rica. SOUTHCOM’s assessment of the political situation prevailed over any liberal hesitancy about the coup: ‘To defeat Zelaya, the de facto government [of Roberto Micheletti] needs only to endure until new elections occur’. This election was held in November 2009 under military rule. It resulted in the victory of the right-wing National Party’s Porfirio Lobo Sosa, who reversed the process of reform started by Zelaya.\n  Colectivo Culturas Vivas, Senderos latinos / Latino paths, Honduras, 2019\n  Part 2: The Swift Descent into the Extreme Right\nIn the immediate aftermath of the coup, the military and the police arrested and harassed those who opposed it. The threats and acts of violence did not abate with the election of Lobo, with at least eighteen journalists, human rights defenders, and movement leaders killed in the months after his inauguration.\nNone of these documented cases of violence perpetrated by the coup regime could come before the courts. This was largely because of the actions of the Supreme Court, which endorsed the coup on the day that it happened, rejected any constitutional appeals that challenged the Micheletti government, and – in May 2010 – removed four judges who questioned the coup’s legality. Despite immediately suspending aid after the coup, the US government soon resumed military aid, USAID money, and money through the anti-drug trafficking Mérida Initiative. The Obama administration openly lobbied for the governments of Micheletti and Lobo; its military and civilian aid publicly validated US recognition of the coup regime.\nLobo’s government gave amnesty to the coup plotters, amongst whom was Juan Orlando Hernández, who became the president of the Congress in January 2010. Hernández used his post to create an effective dictatorship of the National Party, with the military right behind it at every step. There was the Anti-Terrorism Financing Law (2010), the Special Law on Wiretapping (2011), and a law that created the National Security and Defence Council (2011). These laws weakened the Congress and the judiciary and centralised power in the office of the presidency. Faced with judges unwilling to go ahead with the Lobo-Hernández plans for privatisation and with Hernández’ desire for a second term, Hernández fired judges in the middle of the night in what has come to be called el golpe técnico (‘the technical coup’).\nThe social impact of the coup regime’s lawlessness was almost immediate. The National University’s Observatory on Violence tracked the increase in criminality. The data was so dramatic that it led the OAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) to release reports that warned of Honduras’ slide into general social violence. For example, the IACHR noted:\nFor years, the Inter-American Commission has monitored the high levels of citizen insecurity in Honduras and its effects on the effective enjoyment of human rights. The State recognizes that in the last decade it has been one of the most violent countries in the world, having reached in 2011 a rate of 86.5 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants. It also indicates that drug dealing and organized crime constitute a factor generating violence, which have infiltrated several state institutions.\nIt is this general violence that led the mass migrations out of Honduras to triple in the years following the coup, including in 2021.\nIn the aftermath of the coup, Cuban Ambassador Juan Carlos Hernández Padrón, with the support of the Nicaraguan and Venezuelan ambassadors, opened the doors of his embassy åto protect the lives of those whom the coup sought to persecute. Zelaya’s foreign minister Patricia Rodas took shelter there after it became clear that the military had her in its sights.\nHaving legitimised the coup and strengthened the presidency, the right-wing candidate and coup plotter Juan Orlando Hernández ran for the post in 2013 and won against Xiomara Castro, Zelaya’s wife. He had the full support of the National Party of Honduras (PNH) and the military, as well as the United States. Allegations of fraud dogged that election. Salvador Romero, who headed Bolivia’s election agency and who was hired by the US government’s parastatal agency, the National Democratic Institute, worked in Honduras during the election process. Confronted with evidence of fraud and state violence – including the assassination of two leaders of the National Centre of Farmworkers (CNTC) María Amparo Pineda Duarte and Julio Ramón Maradiaga – Romero told the New York Times that, despite ‘the general perception of fraud’, the election was legitimate. The US government backed this assessment as did the Honduran agencies controlled by the oligarchy.\nNew structures, such as the National Interagency Security Force (FUSINA) and the Military Police for Public Order (PMOP), enabled Hernández to exercise control over both the military and the police. Both structures – ­already pliant to the post-coup National Party regime ­– now became institutionally subordinate to the presidency. Many key PMOP officials were trained by US Southern Command and several of them have been accused of murder, torture, and sexual violence. A general atmosphere of impunity pervades the presidential security state run by Hernández.\nSuch harsh measures fell into place to reverse Zelaya’s social democratic advances and to sell the country (vendepatria) to the overall interests of key sectors of international capital. Hernández pushed through an array of laws to privatise energy, water, social security, health, education, and the mining sector. Zelaya’s moratorium on mining concessions was revoked and new policies were put in place that discarded the possibility of any consultation by the communities that lived where the mining was to take place. Evictions of the poor – especially the indigenous poor – came alongside the granting of concessions to foreign companies that had collaborations with a few wealthy Honduran families.\nThe situation of the indigenous and afro-descendants has worsened since the coup, with conflicts rife over their land for mining and tourism projects. There are roughly 837 potential mining projects on what amounts to 35% of Honduran land, according to a 2015 IACHR report. A large number of the sizable projects are on indigenous and afro-descendant land, including 98 mining concessions in the Departments of Lempira and Santa Bárbara, where the Indigenous Lenca people live, and where much of COPINH’s organising takes place. Additionally, there are 76 hydroelectric projects in 14 of the 18 departments of the country.\nThese concessions were consolidated through the creation of Zones for Employment and Economic Development (ZEDE), which allow private, often foreign, firms a free hand to manage labour and the land. In October 2012, the Supreme Court said that the ZEDEs were legal entities; this was further established through the legislature in June 2013 by the Organic Law of Employment and Economic Development Zones.\nOver three hundred concessions were given out for hydroelectric projects and a hundred other concessions were given for mining operations. Many of the ZEDE projects opened up one third of the Caribbean coast of Honduras to tourism, ports, and mineral exploration (including for oil). A combination of tax exemptions and guaranteed investments with zero losses provided foreign and Honduran capital with enormous advantages. Former military men, such as Roberto David Castillo Mejía, exchanged their uniforms for suits and profited from the coup regime. Honduras, the National Party-military regime announced, is open for business.\nReflecting on the ZEDE laws, Berta Cáceres Flores of COPINH said:\nthe ZEDEs or ‘model cities’ are a complete surrender of what was left of the sovereignty of what is known as the State of Honduras. The laws and Free Trade Agreements that they promote don’t even have to go through the National Congress. It is pure neoliberalism; they are handing over huge swaths of land to transnational companies, which will have their own armies, their own migratory systems, legislative systems, their own systems of government, their own system of justice. It is so ridiculous that they have already made a committee, and they call it ‘good practices’. This is the discourse of the transnational companies. They talk about ‘mitigation’. There is a committee of 21 very powerful businessmen; 17 of them are foreigners. It is one of the most aggressive instances of plundering and displacement that we have seen, and they already have defined the places where they will begin. They are Indigenous and black lands of the peasant and fishing communities in the south of the country. It is one of the worst things that we, as Honduran people, are suffering.\nThe coup regime has been led by three administrations under the National Party: Roberto Micheletti (2009-2010), Porfirio Lobo Sosa (2010-2014), and Juan Orlando Hernández (2014-present). Each of these administrations is beholden to the Honduran oligarchy, the Honduran military forces, and the United States government. As a consequence of the coup regime’s policies, poverty rates in Honduras escalated; as of 2018, 62% of the population lives in poverty, with 38.7% in extreme poverty.\n  Roberto Paz, Un registro de nuestro legado lenca / A record of our Lenca heritage, Honduras, 2019\n  The nature of the coup regime became clear once again in 2015 when Hernández announced that he would seek re-election in 2017. This was despite the fact that one of the reasons given for the overthrow of Zelaya was that he allegedly wanted to seek a second term in violation of the Constitution’s one term limit. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal (Tribunal Supremo Electoral, TSE) backed Hernández by a narrow vote, which allowed him to lead the National Party to the polls. The election that took place in November 2017 was marked by widespread accusations of fraud. The fact that Hernández ran for the election – despite constitutional term limits that had earlier been used as a pretext to overthrow Zelaya – and that there were proven accusations of fraud mark the nature of this regime.\nFrom the day of the election onwards, the country was swept into a historic wave of protests, surpassing the levels of mobilisation seen in 2009 against the coup. Road blockades and mobilisations were documented in 15 of Honduras’ 18 departments and were organised at 150 points across national territory. The slogan Fuera JOH (‘Get out JOH’, referring to Juan Orlando Hernández) appeared on walls across the country. This remains a key slogan of progressive forces. Later, the UN Human Rights Council (OHCHR) office in Honduras investigated human rights violations; its 2017 report provided factual evidence of the annulment of democracy in Honduras. The OHCHR report detailed the state’s intimidation of the political opposition and journalists:\nAt the time of completing this report, on 27 January, OHCHR had registered that at least 23 people were killed in the context of the post-electoral protests, including 22 civilians and one police officer. Based on its monitoring, OHCHR considered that at least 16 of the victims were shot to death by the security forces, including two women and two children, and that at least 60 people were injured, half of them by live ammunitions.\nIn addition, OHCHR found that mass arrests took place, and that at least 1,351 people were detained between 1 and 5 December for violating the curfew. OHCHR also received credible and consistent allegations of ill-treatment at the time of arrest and/or during detention. It also received reports of illegal house raids conducted by members of the security forces. Another concern during the period under review is the surge in threats and intimidation against journalists, media workers, social and political activists.\nThe Committee of Relatives of the Detained and Disappeared in Honduras (COFADEH) released an independent report on the repression after the election, which estimated that at least 33 people had been killed between 26 November 2017 and 23 January 2018; 232 people had been injured between 26 November and 31 December; and a minimum of 1,396 people had been detained, with charges filed against 117 of them. Media reports on 4 December 2017 suggested that at least 1,350 people had been detained.\nBefore the violence had even ended, the US State Department’s spokesperson Heather Nauert congratulated Hernández while using boiler-plate language about the need for a ‘national dialogue’ to ‘heal the political divide’. After the US recognised Hernández’s ‘victory,’ other countries followed suit.\nMeanwhile, filings in US Courts in 2021 revealed that the US government’s own Drug Enforcement Agency had evidence that Hernández, his brother Tony Hernández, and the former president Porfirio Lobo had used ‘drug trafficking to help assert power and control in Honduras’. In 2018, a case was opened against Tony Hernández in the Southern District of New York for being central to a conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States. The US prosecutors said that Hernández had ‘accepted millions of dollars in drug-trafficking proceeds and, in exchange, promised drug traffickers protection from prosecutors, law enforcement, and [later] extradition to the United States’.\nUS Prosecutor Jason Richman accused President Hernández of being the recipient of $1 million in cash from the Mexican drug baron Joaquín ‘El Chapo’ Guzmán. President Hernández denied these charges. This avalanche of accusations came alongside the weakening of criminal laws in Honduras to the benefit of criminal conspiracies, including drug traffickers. For example, before the highly partisan court had finished its investigation, changes to the law of the Court of Audit (Tribunal Superior de Cuentas) and the Criminal Procedure Code weakened the ability of the Attorney General to start corruption cases and conduct surprise searches of suspects.\nHonduras’ Congress passed a new criminal code in 2020 after four years of debate by the weakened opposition and by institutions such as the Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH). MACCIH, an independent body set up by the OAS to investigate corruption in the country, said in a detailed study that the new law ‘would affect the investigation and criminal prosecution of crimes related to corruption in the country’. Two years earlier, in 2018, MACCIH had handed investigators the results of a probe into corruption allegations against officials from the ruling National Party. The ‘Pandora Corruption Case’ revealed that 38 former and current members of Congress, most of whom were from the National Party, were accused of diverting public funds for political campaigns and receiving money from drug traffickers. Several deputies were arrested in July 2018 but were released shortly after. No wonder that MACCIH and other institutions have been defanged by these ‘reforms’.\n  Muralists with COPINH, 2016\n  Part 3: The Vicious Attack on the Honduran Left\nAfter the coup d’état, the country was paralysed for months by a series of mass mobilisations that called for the reinstatement of Zelaya. Daily protests took place in Tegucigalpa; these went on for months as communities outside the capital formed caravans to drive – and, after the military took their vehicles, to walk – to the capital city. Almost all social and political movements of the left and the centre-left joined together during these mobilisations to form the National Front of Popular Resistance (FNRP). A discussion within the FNRP took place at several large assemblies around the question of whether to remain a front of mobilisation or to transform itself into a political party.\nTwo years after the coup, in 2011, the FNRP along with a range of people’s movements and labour unions launched the political party Liberty and Refoundation, or Libre, with Zelaya as its president. Gerardo Torres, international secretary of Libre, told us about the three blocs that make up his party:\nThe first bloc is made up of the Liberal Party [of Honduras] that left along with Zelaya after the coup d’état. The second is made up of groups that had never participated in politics; these are groups that were formed in the struggle against corruption, groups that had a critique of the traditional vendepatria [traitor] of Honduran politics. The third bloc is made up of those of us from the traditional Left … which has always been anti-imperialist and has survived in one way or another despite everything that happened in the region: exile, the dictatorship, disappearances, guerrilla struggles. We inherit the legacy of the FMLN of El Salvador, the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity. In Honduras, we had our own processes of liberation, such as the Lorenzo Zelaya Popular Revolutionary Forces, the Cinchoneros Movement, and others, but they were unable to develop like those of our neighbours. This is partly because, for a long time, we have had the largest US military base in Latin America, the one in Palmerola. Creating a guerrilla movement with the capacity to liberate the country was very difficult precisely because of the presence of the Marines some 80 kilometres from Tegucigalpa. This small Left that survived took up a significant part of the leadership of the FNRP after the coup. With Libre, we have a broad platform of popular resistance from the Left to the centre Left. With Libre’s leadership, we have been able to bring together everyone who is against this puppet government, come to an agreement, and raise proposals.\nLibre has helped organise struggles against the coup regime and build an apparatus to contest elections. Despite the repression – including the assassination of its leaders – and widespread election fraud, Libre’s percentage of votes in the presidential election increased from 29% (2013) to 41.4% (2017). Austerity policies by the government increased the viability of a left project while at the same time demoralising society and making it difficult to conduct political activities. Nonetheless, in the period since 2009, a range of political projects have emerged including the revitalisation of the Communist Party of Honduras and the formation of an Anti-Corruption Party (Partido Anticorrupción, PAC), which is led by centre-right Salvador Nasralla (the presidential candidate of Libre in 2017).\nWaves of revolt shaped the opposition to the coup regime. In 2015, a series of anti-corruption protests developed around the antorchas (torches) and indignados (indignant) manifestations. This anti-corruption movement pointed its finger at the rot in public health and public infrastructure, two domains where embezzlement had shaped the decline in services and institutions. Demands to create a proper commission of enquiry into corruption (such as the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, CICIG) were met with an anaemic response and the creation of the OAS’s MACCIH in 2016, which was weakened every year thereafter and was eventually dismantled in 2020.\nIn May and June 2019, health care workers and educators took to the streets to defend public health and public health sectors from the virus of privatisation. They demanded immediate investment to save these key sectors, which had been hollowed out by the neoliberal policies of the previous decade. At the heart of these protests was Fuera JOH, the demand to end the coup regime led by Hernández.\nThe approach of the coup regime for the past decade has been to fragment mobilisations, to destroy the Left, and to undermine its confidence by picking off one social movement leader after another. According to a report by the Washington Office on Latin America, between 2014 and 2017, a total of 141 human rights defenders were killed and attempts were made against the lives of 13 others. Ten of those who were killed had been awarded precautionary security measures by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. This did not help.\nNumbers of murders of social movement leaders since 2009 have not been easy to get. The information is fragmented, and government agencies have no interest in keeping track of disappearances and deaths. However, it is safe to say that upwards of 200 such leaders have been killed between 2009 and 2020. Many of those killed were leaders of indigenous and afro-descendent communities who have struggled against the expropriation of their lands. The IACHR points to three general areas of concern:\nThe creation of grave insecurity and violence resulting from the imposition of plans and projects for resource extraction and energy development in ancestral lands.\nThe forced pillage of and displacement from these lands using excessive force.\nThe persecution and criminalisation of indigenous leaders for motives directly linked to their defence of their lands. The violence against indigenous leaders and communities emerges directly from the struggle over land.\nTo explore this in greater detail, we will look at the 2016 murder of Berta Cáceres Flores, a leader and co-founder of COPINH; the attack on trade unions; and, most recently, the forced disappearance of Garifuna social leaders.\n  Colectivo Culturas Vivas, Plumas en cantos / Feathers in song, Tegucigalpa, Honduras, 2020\n  The Assassination of Berta Cáceres\nOn 15 July 2013, COPINH, led by Berta Cáceres Flores, went to protest the construction of a hydroelectric dam on the Gualcarque River. This river in western Honduras is considered to be sacred by the indigenous Lenca community, but no one from the company that wanted to build the dam had talked to them. The company, Desarrollos Energéticos Sociedad Anónima (DESA), is owned and controlled by one of the most powerful families in Honduras, the Atala Zablahs. The Honduran Army, at the behest of DESA, guarded the site.\nDuring the protest, the soldiers opened fire at the protesters and killed Tomás García. Almost three years later, on 2 March 2016, gunmen broke into the home of Berta Cáceres and assassinated her. Berta’s assassination was soon followed by the 15 March 2016 murder of Nelson Noé García of COPINH and the 18 October 2016 murders of José Ángel Flores and Silmer Dionisio George of the Unified Campesino Movement of the Aguán, or MUCA.\nAfter Berta’s assassination, a concerted campaign to demand justice was launched by COPINH as well as Berta’s family, with support from organisations globally. Even under immense international pressure, the Honduran investigators limited themselves to the arrest of the main shooters and some of their immediate handlers. These handlers include Douglas Bustillo, a former head of security at DESA who ran the operation; Sergio Rodríguez, an executive at DESA; and Roberto David Castillo Mejía, the president of DESA. Berta’s killer and some of their immediate handlers have been sentenced to prison terms that will run from 30 years to 50 years.\nHowever, none of the intellectual authors of the crime have been arrested. Evidence presented in the court – including phone logs and WhatsApp conversations – shows quite conclusively that these assassins, many of them veterans of the Honduran army, acted on the orders of the executives of DESA. None of the owners of DESA, including members of the oligarchic Atala Zablah family who were part of these WhatsApp chats, have been charged with a crime.\nThe owners of DESA and members of the government are also among the intellectual authors of these assassinations, with David Castillo being the senior-most DESA official who was arrested. Authorities detained him on 2 March 2018 while he was attempting to flee to the United States, where he had bought a luxury house worth USD 1.4 million in Houston, Texas just 8 months after Berta’s assassination. The call logs and WhatsApp messages show that he had participated in the conspiracy and served as the key link between the financers and those carrying it out. However, the case against him has stalled. The reiterated delay has opened up the possibility that his preventative detention could expire, leading to his release.\nAuthorities have been shielding the Atala Zablah family and the ruling party, which had itself tried to collude in the cover-up. After Berta was assassinated, President Hernández’s minister of security Julián Pacheco Tinoco wrote to Pedro Atala Zablah, one of the leaders of the Atala Zablah family and a board member of DESA. He wanted to assure Atala Zablah and his family that the government would not pursue the case with any seriousness; the case, he said, would be seen as a ‘crime of passion’. Bertha Zúniga Cáceres, Berta’s daughter and now the general coordinator of COPINH, reiterated this level of collusion: ‘neither the army nor the company acted alone’. Rather, there is ‘coordination between the economic and military power centres, which is the essence of the dictatorship under which we live in Honduras’.\nIndeed, the investigation ­– and the court records – show a very high level of collusion. DESA officials would meet in the presidential house as they plotted how to undermine COPINH. This should raise eyebrows about the complicity at the highest level in the murder of Berta Cáceres. But this has been set aside. So have the many WhatsApp messages that show the Atala Zablah family members urging the team to do something about Berta Cáceres in very coded language.\nThere is ample evidence of DESA officials bragging about how they have the government – and in particular the armed forces and police – in their pocket. In 2013, DESA’s chief financial officer, Daniel Atala Midence, said ‘I have spent a lot of money and political capital to get those three arrest warrants’; within a very short time Berta Cáceres, Tomás Gómez Membreño, and Aureliano Molina were arrested. This showed the extent of Atala Midence’s influence. At another point in the WhatsApp conversations, Pedro Atala Zablah said that the DESA officials, who had already used the Honduran Army and police to guard their site and attack COPINH activists, should pay the police ‘with something more than food’ to get them to do its bidding.\nIn August 2019, the UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights went to Honduras. This is a group that tries to get countries to adopt the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The principles are rather empty, but at the very least they suggest that companies must not behave in a criminal way nor should business deals be made in secret. In their public report, the Working Group made two important points. First, they said that even though the Ministry of Environment (MiAmbiente) says that they hold open consultations when environmental licenses are being considered, most of these meetings are held only after the licenses have been granted. This is precisely what happened in the case of the Agua Zarca dam case and is the basis for another case brought forth by COPINH against David Castillo and 15 other public functionaries alleging that fraud was committed during the granting of operation licenses for the Agua Zarca project. Second, the law (Legislative Decree 418-2013) and two ministerial decrees (725-2008 and 1402-2018) allow the ministry to classify elements of the Environmental Impact Study and whatever they deem as ‘Secret Information’. What this means is that those concerned about a case have no access to free and fair information to deliberate its merits; the government can easily shuffle the paperwork through in a thoroughly undemocratic manner.\nLaura Zúniga, one of Berta’s daughters and also part of COPINH, said in her victim’s impact statement in 2018:\nFrom the moment my mom was murdered, we were excluded from the process, and we don’t agree with it. We don’t agree with being denied the possibility of having an observer present during my mom’s autopsy, of not receiving information. We’ve had to fight for information at every moment, every step of the way. We didn’t do it on a whim, we did it because we are prepared to do everything necessary to get to the truth because we understand that it’s our right, because we understand that it’s the right of the Honduran people, because we want to establish precedents for justice.\n  Muralists with COPINH, 2016\n  The Sustained Attack on Trade Unions\nIn the lead-up to the tenth anniversary of the coup in 2019, a wave of protests took place in Honduras. In the leadership of this upsurge was the Platform for the Defence of Health and Education or La Plataforma, a joint front of teachers and medical workers. On 30 May, thousands of health care workers dressed in scrubs and white coats, alongside teachers and students, paralysed Tegucigalpa with their street demonstrations. Protestors marched to the Toncontín International Airport while a dump truck unloaded rocks and dirt on the main road into the airport. The police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the crowd, but the tear gas drifted into the airport and shut it down. It did not stop the protests, which grew over the next few weeks.\nThe immediate impulse for the protests organised by La Plataforma was the Hernández government’s drive to privatise the health care and education sectors. In January 2019, Hernández pushed through special decrees that declared ‘national emergencies’ in the health and education sectors. The government created special commissions that would reorganise the health and education professions along lines that strike at the relative autonomy of the public sector. The names of the bills passed by the Congress are instructive: the Special Commission for the Transformation of the National Health System (PCM 026-2018) and the Special Commission for the Transformation of the Education System (PCM 027-2018). In April, the Honduran Congress passed the Law of Restructuring and Transformation of the National Health and Education System, whose purpose was to advance the privatisation of these two sectors. Because of the protests by the education and health care workers, the Congress nullified the law on 30 April.\nBehind Hernández stood the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has long called upon Honduras to ‘rationalise’ its spending and to ‘institutionalis[e] fiscal prudence’; this last phrase appears in the July 2019 staff report on Honduras. When the IMF talks about ‘fiscal prudence’, it means budget cuts to the public sector, with the most frequent cuts in the health and education sectors. Stung by the resistance of La Plataforma, Hernández moved – through the National Roundtable on Health and Education – to ‘decentralise’ health and education delivery to local governments that are largely starved of funds. This is a sure way to get these local governments to hand over the provision of health and education to non-governmental entities and to the private sector. This is privatisation in the name of decentralisation.\nThe repression of the protests came alongside threats and violence against union leaders. In 2019, the International Trade Union Confederation found that Honduras has ‘no guarantee of rights’ for union members. A UNHCR report found that, between 2010 and 2019, 90 teachers – many of them union leaders – were murdered. In December 2019, the Honduran Network Against Anti-Union Violence affirmed the dangerous nature of unionism in the country; on 16 November, labour leader Jorge Alberto Acosta Barrientos of the Tela Railroad Company Workers’ Union (SITRATERCO) was shot to death. Other union leaders agree that the threats and violence against workers are pressing dangers, among them María Gloria García of the Federation of Trade Unions of Agro-industrial Workers (FESTAGRO), Tomás Membreño Pérez of the Union of Agro-industrial and Allied Workers (STAS), Sonia Margarita Banegas of the Workers’ Union of the National Autonomous University of Honduras (SITRAUNAH), and Joel Almendares of the main trade union federation in Honduras, Single Confederation of workers of Honduras (CUTH).\nWorkers in trade unions understand that their fight is not only against this or that law or for this or that reform; their fight is to overturn the coup regime and to undermine the classes that back it.\nOne long-standing fight has been led by the workers in the palm oil industry and large private corporations such as Dinant, which is supported by the coup government as well as the World Bank, from whom it has received funding. Dinant is owned by one of Central America’s most powerful families, the Facussés. In the Bajo Aguán valley where Dinant operates, at least 133 farm workers have been killed over the past decade. The intimacy between the Facussé family and the Hernández government illustrates the class nature of the 2009 coup and the rigidities enforced by the coup regime. In one of many examples of this, it was Facussé’s aircraft that was used to illegally extradite Foreign Minister Patricia Rodas from Honduras to Mexico during the 2009 coup.\nThe Facussé family has been involved in a long fight against the Garifuna community in Vallecito over land rights. In 2004, the vice president of an agricultural cooperative, Santos Euquerio Bernárdez Bonilla, was kidnapped and killed. Since the coup, the violence has intensified and so has the general destruction of the land to benefit these powerful families and their class interests. In 2014, the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR) reported on this situation:\nThe Commission was also told that processes to grant concessions to companies have been accompanied by considerable repression of indigenous peoples, who had been forcibly evicted. ‘People are distressed because of the dispossessions and evictions carried out against the Garifuna community’, a member of the Garifuna people told the IACHR. The Commission was also informed that the extensive production of African palm in the northern part of the country has had a disproportionate impact on the Garifuna people. The IACHR also received troubling information concerning the impact of human activity in exacerbating poverty in these communities. For example, the Garifuna community of Santa Rosa indicates that as a result of the work done by companies cultivating African palm in the department of Colón, the course of the Aguán River had been changed, with devastating consequences on the environment and on the community’s access to water, due to the water’s high salinity.\nThe companies in question include those of the Facussé family. The workers facing this pillage include members of the Garifuna community.\n  Sarina Martínez, Vivos los llevaron / They took them alive, Honduras, 2020\n  The Forced Disappearance of Garifuna Leaders\nOn 18 July 2020, ten heavily armed men arrived in the Triunfo de la Cruz community. They wore Military Police of Public Order (PMOP) uniforms, which carried the insignia of the Police Investigations Directorate (DPI). These men kidnapped five members of the Garifuna community, an Afro-Indigenous community on the Caribbean coast of Honduras. The men that went missing that day were Junior Juárez as well as four members of the Black Fraternal Organisation of Honduras (OFRANEH): Snider Centeno, Milthon Joel Martínez Suany, Suami Mejía, and Gerardo Róchez. They have not been seen since.\nOFRANEH released a statement saying that they must be released immediately: ‘They were taken alive; we want them back alive’. Miriam Miranda, a leader of OFRANEH, tweeted that ‘In this mafia-like, corrupt, and murderous dictatorship, the machine of death is untouched and strengthened. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, an armed group arrived in Triunfo de la Cruz and took, among others, the leader Sneider Centeno. We demand his immediate appearance, alive’.\nCenteno is the president of the Triunfo de la Cruz Garifuna community and a member of OFRANEH. He was at the forefront of a case brought to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) by his community of Triunfo de la Cruz in 2015. The case accused the Honduran state of human rights violations and of failing to protect their territories and stop the displacement of communities by those with economic and political power. Though the IACHR ruled in favour of the community, the state has yet to fulfil its commitments. OFRANEH points to the Honduran state’s failure to comply with the IACHR’s ruling as evidence that the state is not invested in the well-being of the Garifuna people.\nThis kidnapping is part of a pattern; OFRANEH says that over the past few years, at least forty members of the Garifuna community have been assassinated and many have had to leave the community due to threats and persecution. These attacks come both from the state and transnational corporations and include assassinations and other forms of political persecution.\nDuring the eight months since this kidnapping, the Garifuna communities in Triunfo de la Cruz and Sambo Creek have mobilised to demand that the authorities immediately provide information about those who have been disappeared and return them to their community alive. Rather than comply with these demands, the police have attacked protestors with tear gas on several occasions and community members have reported that heavily armed vehicles have entered the Triunfo de la Cruz community to engender fear and terror.\nThe police repression deepens the suspicion in the community of the state’s role in the kidnapping. The forced disappearance took place while there was a lockdown and curfew in the country. This means that anyone driving around in the area would need to have explicit permission to do so. ‘It is impossible for us to believe that the movement of the three vehicles that the heavily armed individuals drove could have happened completely without being detected by the state’, OFRANEH alleged.\nOn 31 July, thirteen days after the kidnapping, Hernández broke the government’s silence through a tweet in which he insisted that the government was working to ‘identify those responsible for the crime and bring them to justice’. No progress has been made on the case in the months since. OFRANEH notes that the agency in charge of the case is the Police Investigations Directorate (DPI). Given that the armed men who kidnapped the five people in Triunfo de la Cruz came dressed in Police Investigations Directorate (DPI) uniforms, it is impossible to have faith in the system that seemed to have conducted the crime.\nOn the day of the tweet from Hernández, Amnesty International released a strong statement calling on the government to investigate the kidnapping and locate the men. In this statement, Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International commented:\nWe demand that the Juan Orlando Hernández administration take urgent measures to find the five missing people, including four Garifuna activists from the Black Fraternal Organization of Honduras, alive. The authorities must also carry out a swift, exhaustive, independent and impartial investigation to identify and punish all those responsible for planning and carrying out this crime. We cannot allow impunity to encourage endless cycles of violence and grave human rights violations.\nBy October 2020, three months after the men had been kidnapped, OFRANEH released a document that analysed the government’s inconsistent reports to the IACHR. The government’s reports and social media posts appeared more and more like a disinformation campaign, said OFRANEH. The posts aim to discredit the disappeared by linking them to drug trafficking and attempt to brush off the kidnappings by pointing to the high frequency of disappearances. The normalisation of this kind of violence shows that the government accepts that the country is ‘submerged in violence, a result of the current failed state and the gradual collapse of the justice system due to the lack of its independence’, as the OFRANEH report points out. This disinformation campaign came alongside the ‘criminal and complicit silence’ of the government about the actual evidence that was on public display.\nUnable to advance an agenda in the country’s formal institutions, OFRANEH launched the Garifuna Committee for the Investigation and Search of the Disappeared from Triunfo de la Cruz (SUNLA) on 18 February 2021 (SUNLA means ‘enough’ in Garifuna). Miriam Miranda, who coordinates OFRANEH, said that SUNLA would be ‘a way to look for truth and justice in this country’. The committee is made up of various experts and leaders of the community and will have the support of sixteen social organisations from Latin America along with the UN and the IACHR.\n‘We are tired of lies from the government of Honduras’ Miranda said. The reports by the Honduras government ‘have no substance. They don’t say anything. They make a joke of us, the Garifuna people. We do not want lies. We want the truth. We want life to be worth more in our country. We have to build new paths. We will continue fighting so that this becomes a reality’.\n    Colectivo Culturas Vivas, Me lo dijo el río / The river told me so, Honduras, 2021\nDOWNLOAD PDF\nMORE ON THIS TOPIC\nART BULLETIN\nMaking Portraits, Reclaiming our Collective Archive\nDECEMBER 29, 2024\nDOSSIER\nHow Neoliberalism Has Wielded ‘Corruption’ to Privatise Life in Africa\nNOVEMBER 26, 2024\nDOSSIER\nWhat Can We Expect from the New Progressive Wave in Latin America?\nNOVEMBER 14, 2023\nARCHIVE\nSelect Year\n2025\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2019\n2018\nSelect Month\nAugust\nJuly\nJune\nMay\nApril\nMarch\nFebruary\nJanuary\nThey Shall Not Pass: Our Call against Fascism: The Thirty-Fourth Newsletter (2025)\nThomas Sankara’s Legacy is Alive in the Sahel: The Thirty-Third Newsletter (2025)\nA Tribute to All Those Who Fought for a Better World and Died So Young: The Thirty-Second Newsletter (2025)\nSUBSCRIBE\nDONATE\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy & Licence"

Among them was Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, the country’s most famed drug lord and owner of the contra supply airline SETCO, dubbed the “CIA airline”. \nAdvertisement\nIn his multitasking heyday, Matta not only assisted in supplying the contras with their logistical needs, but also contributed to the flow of narcotics to the US.\nIt’s this sort of arrangement that makes a mockery of continuing US drug war rhetoric, which excuses the militarisation of the hemisphere and allows the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to transcend borders at will, while US borders are increasingly fortified.\nCaught in the crossfire\nIn a 2012 incident involving DEA agents in Honduras, four poor Afro-indigenous canoe passengers -including a 14-year-old boy and a pregnant single mother – were mistaken for drug traffickers and killed in a helicopter operation.\nIn addition to flying in the face of Zoellick’s suggestion that CAFTA would somehow help resolve the drug trafficking mess in Central America, the affair was perhaps a good example of what can happen when US law enforcement agencies prioritise justifying their budgets over safeguarding human rights.\nIndeed, when it comes to crime-fighting systems imported from the US, it seems Honduran civilians are forever getting caught in the crossfire – although some would argue that it’s not an issue of crossfire at all.\nProtesters chanted slogans against Hernandez as they marched to the presidential palace [Reuters] \nMaria Luisa Borjas, the former chief of internal affairs for the Honduran police force, herself confirmed to me during a conversation in 2009, that approximately 3,000 young people had been murdered by the state during the presidency of Ricardo Maduro (2002-06).\nInspired by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Maduro acted as the ringleader for Honduras’ very own zero tolerance regime, which was characterised, Borjas said, by a criminalisation of youth and a liberal application of the term “gang member” to validate extrajudicial killings.\nAmerican University anthropologist Adrienne Pine has referred to the period as one of “invisible genocide”, primarily against “unemployed young men who were marked as criminals by a society that had no room for them”.\nCoup time\nAccording to Zoellick’s menacing calculations in 2005, a voting down of CAFTA would mean that Central American “wages will be lower, and a door to upward mobility for the region’s poor will be slammed in their face”. But in the decade since the agreement’s ratification, there’s no evidence that any more room has been made in Honduran society for the poor.\nThis could have been predicted from the get-go by anyone who paid scant attention to NAFTA, the 1994 free trade accord that lowered wages in Mexico, raised unemployment, and forced two million Mexican farmers to abandon their land thanks to US export subsidies.\nWhen Maduro’s successor Manuel Zelaya dared to ever-so-slightly challenge the US-sponsored landscape in Honduras – earning a caricature among the fanatical Honduran elite as a die-hard communist puppet of Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro – he was overthrown in a military coup on June 28, 2009.\nThe post-coup era has seen soaring homicide rates, with much of the violence committed by state security forces enjoying near-total impunity.\n  His transgressions had included bringing the urban minimum wage up to $290 a month, demonstrating less than complete obsequiousness to mining and other foreign corporations, and proposing a bit more democratic participation by the Honduran citizenry.\nFormally, he was accused of attempting to violate the national constitution by revising Article 239, which prohibited the re-election of presidents. In April of this year, the very same article was conveniently done away with by the current right-wing government of Juan Orlando Hernandez, himself instrumental in the overthrow of Zelaya.\nThe US, for its part, did its best to legitimise the 2009 coup while pretending not to. After hemming and hawing for months about whether or not a coup perpetrated by the military qualified as a military coup and thus necessitated punitive financial measures, the US recognised the outcome of illegitimate Honduran elections held in November 2009 by the coup-installed regime. And poof, Honduras was restored to the realm of democracy.\nReaping the rewards\nBut the post-coup era has seen soaring homicide rates, with much of the violence committed by state security forces enjoying near-total impunity. And from the looks of it, these same forces are slated for more handouts from the imperial benefactor to the north.\nIn a recent op-ed for Al Jazeera America, historian Dana Frank writes that, despite Hernandez’s flagrant violations of the rule of law, his excessive militarisation policies, and his repression of civil liberties, “the White House is aggressively pushing for a billion dollars in aid to Central America, much of which will flow to Honduras, including a tripling of military funding.”\nAdvertisement\nThis, Frank contends, is “tantamount to rewarding Hernandez and other Honduran elites for the very crisis they created”.\nBut seeing as the crisis is far from 100 percent Made in Honduras, it seems there are plenty of rewards to go around.\nBelen Fernandez is the author of The Imperial Messenger: Thomas Friedman at Work, published by Verso.

As the army disarmed the presidential guard, the soldiers ushered Zelaya into a van and took him to an air force base where he was escorted onto an airplane that immediately left the country. Zelaya said he did not know where he was going until he arrived in San José, Costa Rica.   \n“I have been kidnapped,” he told a packed press conference later that day from Costa Rica. “Violently, brutally kidnapped.” \nWhat an independent truth commission would later call “a coup,” was the culmination of months of political turmoil in the country. Zelaya claimed he was simply holding a referendum, scheduled for that very June 28, to determine if Honduras should include a so-called “fourth ballot box” in the upcoming November national elections. The fourth ballot box would give voters the opportunity to ask for a constitutional assembly. Zelaya’s rivals — which included his own party in congress as well as three of four other political parties in the legislative branch, the Supreme Court, the military, the Catholic Church and the country’s top business associations — said he had ignored court rulings that made his referendum unconstitutional and was seeking to perpetuate his presidential term like his ally, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, had already done in Venezuela on numerous occasions. US officials later said they had tried to stave off the removal of Zelaya, but the Honduras military had broken off talks on the day of Zelaya’s ousting. \n*This article is part of a multipart investigation looking at organized crime in Venezuela. See other parts of the series here and the full report here.\nTo be sure, behind “the coup” in Honduras was the specter of Venezuela. During his presidential campaign in 2005, Zelaya had run as an able businessman and moderate reformist for the center-right Liberal Party (Partido Liberal – PL). After facing opposition for many of his proposals from his Liberal Party colleagues and the rival National Party (Partido Nacional – PN), Zelaya had turned to leftist coalitions and unions for support of his agenda. To the consternation of business elites, he raised wages of public and private sector employees, including increasing the minimum wage for all workers by 60 percent. And to the horror of the political elites, he joined Petrocaribe and the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (Alternativa Bolivariana para las Americas – ALBA), Chavez’s regional economic and political alliance, which acted as a counterweight to the US-led trade agreements in the region. \nThe irony, of course, is that ALBA would have little impact on Honduras compared to the coup that ousted its one-time executive promotor. In fact, the chaos that followed Zelaya’s removal from office opened the door to a period of unprecedented criminal activity in the country, which deeply altered Honduras’ political, economic and social landscape. Like ALBA, it emanated from Venezuela and included Venezuelan official participation. Unlike ALBA, it involved some of the same political interests in Honduras that had sought to undermine Zelaya.    \nChaos and Criminal Opportunity\nFollowing the coup against Zelaya, Congress installed the head of the legislative body, Roberto Micheletti of the PL, as interim president. The international community, including the US government, rejected Micheletti’s claim to power. Honduras was suspended from the Organization of American States, numerous countries withdrew their ambassadors, and no country recognized Micheletti’s administration. \nPolitical isolation grew as Micheletti declared numerous curfews, shut down opposition media, and dispatched army soldiers and police to quell the protests that had erupted following Zelaya’s removal. These protests only intensified in September 2009, when Zelaya snuck back into the country via a mountain pass and installed himself in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa, which tried to negotiate a deal that would allow him to retake the presidency until the end of his term. Micheletti responded by declaring a 45-day state of siege, which, among other things, suspended various constitutionally guaranteed liberties.\nWith each side entrenched, a stalemate emerged, even as presidential campaigning for the November election had begun. National Party candidate Porfirio Lobo won the vote, which saw 50 percent abstention. For some, it was an affirmation that Hondurans rejected Zelaya’s and his allies’ efforts to boycott the process and have him reinstated. But for others, it was deja vu — an affirmation that the country’s political and economic elites had turned the clock back to the 1980s with the help of the military by deposing a left-leaning president. \nThe US government only reinforced this belief when it recognized the Lobo administration. But the surreal political crisis had hamstrung US cooperation with Honduras, particularly in counternarcotic matters. In the days that followed Zelaya’s ousting, the US government withdrew $33 million in economic and military aid, and it stopped working with the Honduran military and counter-drug forces. At the same time, the Honduran military and police concentrated their forces in Tegucigalpa to deal with the political turmoil. The result was an opening for criminal organizations. \nOne such organization that took advantage was a Colombian-Venezuelan network that operated along the country’s shared borders. It was run by Jose Evaristo Linares Castillo, a long-time associate of Daniel “El Loco” Barrera, who, along with their other associate, Pedro Oliveiro Guerrero, alias “Cuchillo,” used their criminal networks in Colombia to facilitate the movement of cocaine through Venezuela. While Barrera and Guerrero were associated with right-wing paramilitary groups, Linares was alleged to work with the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC).\nThe Linares network included a Colombian-born middle-aged former butcher named Gersain Viafara Mina. Viafara Mina was originally from Cali, Colombia but had resettled in the border state of Apure, Venezuela. And by the time Zelaya was removed from power, Viafara Mina was managing cocaine loads moving from Venezuela through Honduras for Linares and others. In court papers filed by the US government charging Viafara Mina with drug trafficking, an affidavit by a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent says Viafara Mina coordinated numerous flights between the two countries.  \nGersain Viafara Mina\n“Viafara-Mina made arrangements to ship the cocaine from Apure, Venezuela to Central America through sources that supplied cocaine, aircraft, and clandestine airstrips to facilitate the cocaine smuggling operations,” the affidavit, written by agent Kimojah Brooks, reads.  \nThese flights would leave Apure, fly due north towards the Dominican Republic, then take a sharp left along the 15th parallel, which entered Central America along the Honduran-Nicaraguan border. The route allowed these single and twin-engine aircraft to avoid Colombia-based radar detection. The flights were coming in waves, according to a foreign counternarcotic official who was working in Central America at the time and who spoke to InSight Crime on condition of anonymity because some of these cases are still making their way through the US justice system. Each single engine carried, on average, 500 kilograms; each twin engine would take between 800 kilograms and a ton, the counternarcotic official said.   \n“Air tracks continued to proliferate in 2010,” the State Department’s annual assessment of drug trafficking in the region stated in 2011. “The Joint Interagency Task Force South (JIATF-S) recorded 75 suspect air flights into Honduras during the year, compared with 54 in 2009 and 31 in 2008.” \nThe report said the majority were from Venezuela.19 The foreign counternarcotic official was more specific. “If there were 100 [air tracks],” the official said, “probably 95 were coming Venezuela.”\nThe departure point also permitted Viafara Mina and his team to liaison with its support network, which, according to the affidavit, included the FARC and possibly portions of the Venezuelan military. The affidavit is specific on this first point but vague on the second. It says the FARC “provided security at the airstrip” in Apure. But it only makes one specific mention of the Venezuelan authorities, citing an intercepted phone call in which Viafara Mina and a confidential informant identified only as “CC-1” discuss getting an aircraft that had crashed in Apure in May 2011, “from Venezuelan military custody.”  \nOther parts of the affidavit, however, are less specific. In one section, the DEA agent discusses meetings between Viafara Mina and “members of the military of a nearby country.” These military personnel, the affidavit says, “had access to transponder codes that could be used by pilots to fly in that country’s airspace and access clandestine airstrips there used in connection with the transportation of large quantities of cocaine.” The limited geographic scope of Viafara Mina’s team made Venezuela the logical identity of this “nearby country,” but efforts to confirm this with the US Justice Department went unanswered. \nViafara Mina was captured in 2015, when he crossed into Colombia to purchase a light for his car. He was extradited that same year to the United States, leading to more ripple effects in relations between Venezuela and its neighbors. The extradition reportedly caused a commotion on the Venezuela–Colombia border, where Venezuelan authorities temporarily closed passage to Colombia in supposed retaliation for the extradition of Viafara Mina and another suspected Colombian trafficker, whom El Tiempo identified as “a key witness against uniformed [Venezuelan] personnel connected to illegal interests.”  \nThe Impact on Honduras  \nIt was also 2015, the same year Viafara Mina was arrested, when one of the Honduran networks linked to the cocaine air bridge unraveled, taking with it the vast political and economic network it had created. Sometime in January 2015, Javier and Devis Rivera Maradiaga, the two brothers who had created a criminal group popularly known as the Cachiros, went to a Caribbean island and turned themselves into US authorities. They were charged with drug trafficking and quickly began cooperating with US authorities to lower their sentences and get some members of their family out of Honduras. \nThe Cachiros had emerged as cattle rustlers in the eastern state of Colón in 1970s. Early on, they had established ties with elite families, such as the Rosenthal clan, to whom they could sell their livestock. The Rosenthal family had started with insurance companies in the 1930s, but later expanded into meat-packing, real estate, agriculture, cattle, dairy products, tourism, banking, television, telecommunications and other businesses. By the 1970s, they were one of the wealthiest families in Honduras. By the late 1980s, Jaime Rosenthal Oliva, the family patriarch, was a prominent member of the Liberal Party and the country’s vice president. By the 1990s, the family was one of the richest and most powerful in all of Central America. \nSEE ALSO: Cachiros Profile \nOver that same time period, the Cachiros’ criminal portfolio grew to include drug trafficking. The Cachiros were particularly adept at establishing networks that could receive and move cocaine from the coasts and clandestine airstrips of eastern Honduras to Guatemala. In 2004, following a tiff with their chief rival, the Cachiros went on a three-country search-and-destroy mission before catching up to him in a Honduras prison where they had him killed.  \nBy 2009, the year Zelaya was unceremoniously removed from power, the Cachiros were one of the largest illicit transport groups in the country. They had teams of collaborators throughout the area that arranged for the aircraft landings, set up the lights along the clandestine airstrips, offloaded the illicit merchandise and moved it to a safe location. They also established local connections — including with the police, local politicians and judicial authorities — to ensure the drugs would not be confiscated, or if they were, that they could be recovered at a minimal cost.  \nThe price the Cachiros charged for this service was roughly $2,000 per kilogram of cocaine, the difference in cost of cocaine between Nicaragua and Guatemala. The sums of money generated by this business were immense, especially for a place like Honduras. Honduran authorities estimated that by the time they began confiscating the Cachiros’ properties in 2013, the group had accumulated up to $800 million in assets, or about half the total amount of the country’s top export, coffee, during any given year.  \nAs the Cachiros’ illicit businesses grew, so did their connections and their ability to penetrate the highest levels of political life. By the early 2000s, the Cachiros had forged ties with the Rosenthals and other elites in banking, hotels, agribusiness and via a soccer team they helped finance. They used their legitimate businesses to get state contracts to build and maintain roads, as well as work on other infrastructure projects. And they became business partners with the then-first family and possibly the future first family. \nAfter the Rivera Maradiaga brothers handed themselves to US authorities, the consequences for these elites who had worked with the Cachiros came swiftly. In May 2015, in a sting coordinated with Haitian authorities, US authorities arrested Fabio Lobo, the son of former President Porfirio Lobo, the same man who had won the controversial November 2009 election following the ousting of Zelaya. In October 2015, the US Justice Department indicted three members of the Rosenthal family and a lawyer for their business conglomerate on charges of money laundering related to corruption and drug trafficking networks.  \nFabio Lobo\nLobo’s case was particularly damaging for his family. He was taken to the United States, where he pled guilty. At his sentencing hearing, Devis Rivera Maradiaga, the younger of the two Cachiros who had turned himself over to authorities in the Caribbean, testified in a New York City courtroom that Lobo’s father had received bribes in the hundreds of thousands of dollars from the group in return for a promise that the government would not extradite them to the United States, and that Fabio Lobo had worked closely with him to secure and transport at least two loads of cocaine from the Colón area to the Guatemalan border. In his testimony, Rivera Maradiaga also implicated the brother of current President Juan Orlando Hernández to secure money owed to one of his companies.\nThe Rivera Maradiga brothers were also linked to Venezuela’s “narco nephews” case. Supposedly the Cachiros were also connected to Efraín Antonio Campo Flores y Franqui Francisco Flores de Freitas, the nephews of Venezuela’s first lady, Cilia Flores. \nIllustration: Elizabeth Williams  \nAlthough these links have not been proven, there was confirmation that a route via Honduras was envisaged, and that the relatives of the Venezuelan president did have links to Central American criminal groups. For more details on this case, see the chapter on the ‘Cartel of the Suns.’ \nSEE ALSO: Cartel of the Suns Profile \nWhat is clear is that the ouster of Zelaya led to the creation of one of the main cocaine routes from South America to the United States. This route depended on sophisticated drug trafficking structures in Venezuela, and a path of minimal resistance through Honduras.  \nTagged:\nCachiros\nElites and Crime\nHonduras\nInfographics\nNorthern Triangle\nVenezuela\nStay Informed With InSight Crime\nSubscribe to our newsletter to receive a weekly digest of the latest organized crime news and stay up-to-date on major events, trends, and criminal dynamics from across the region.\nSign up\nDonate today to empower research and analysis about organized crime in Latin America and the Caribbean, from the ground up.\nDonate\nWe go into the field to interview, report, and investigate.

Copy may not be in its final form.\nAMY GOODMAN: Manuel Zelaya, the former president of Honduras, returned home on Saturday after 23 months in exile. At a news conference Sunday in his living room, Zelaya said the coup was the work of an international conspiracy that should be investigated. It was the first coup in Central America in a quarter of a century. The military kidnapped Zelaya from his home at gunpoint, put him on a plane to Costa Rica, stopping to refuel at Palmerola, the U.S. military base in Honduras — this after he tried to organize a non-binding referendum asking voters if they wanted to rewrite the constitution. Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos brokered the agreement between ousted President Zelaya and the current Honduran President Porfirio Lobo. It was called the Cartagena Accord, paving the way for Zelaya’s return.\nDemocracy Now! flew with President Zelaya from Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, to Honduras. On Sunday, we sat down with him at his home in Tegucigalpa. I asked President Zelaya to talk about what happened the day of the coup, June 28th, 2009.\nMANUEL ZELAYA: [translated] A president who was elected by the people was taken out of his home at gunpoint in the early, early morning wee hours in his pajamas and taken and abandoned in Costa Rica, in the airport of Costa Rica.\nAMY GOODMAN: But first, can you tell me what exactly happened here? What time was it? What did you hear? How did you wake up?\nMANUEL ZELAYA: [translated] I arrived to my home at 3:30 in the morning. The next day, we were going to have a referendum, public referendum, throughout the whole nation. It was only an opinion poll, basically, and it was not legally binding — 14,000 polls placed all over the country. And there was an international conspiracy in order to say that communism was entering into this country and that the Caracas plan was going to enter in to destroy the United States and that we are destroying the U.S. empire, if they would let that opinion poll take place. Many who were business leaders and others, high society folks, they fell into that trap. This coup d’état was made by the right wing of the United States.\nThose early morning hours, in the wee hours of that morning, they started to pressure the honor guard. They came here at 5:15 in the morning. There were isolated shots that were fired in the neighborhood, some in this street over here and others in the back part of the house. You can see that this is a small house, middle class. It’s easy to assault this house. I was woken by the gunshots. I went downstairs in my pajamas to the first floor, on the patio on the outside. At that very moment, the gunshots were impacting on the door in the back. My first reaction was to hit the floor and to cover myself from the gunshots. That is the moment in which the military entered into the patio in the back.\nThey threatened me with their rifles, M-16 machine guns. They said that it was a military order. And they were shouting at me, and they were ordering me to give my cell phone, because I was talking on my phone. There were more than 10 military, who were hooded, who entered into the house, actually. But outside there were 200 to 300. The only thing you could see were their eyes. Everything else was covered. And they surrounded me. They threatened me, that they were going to shoot. And I said to them, “If you have orders to shoot, then shoot me. But know that you are shooting the president of the republic, and you are a subalternate, you are an underling.” And so, they did not shoot at me.\nAnd so, they forced me to go to their vehicles outside with my pajamas on. We landed in the U.S. military base of Palmerola. There, they refueled. There were some movements that happened outside. I don’t know what conversations took place. About 15, 20 minutes, we waited there in the airport of Palmerola. And then to Costa Rica, and everything else is public after that.\nAMY GOODMAN: Why were you brought to the U.S. military base? It is not that far to fly from Tegucigalpa airport to Costa Rica. Why would you be brought to the U.S. military base? And they must have had the U.S. military’s permission.\nMANUEL ZELAYA: [translated] The U.S. State Department has always denied, and they continue to deny, any ties with the coup d’état. Nevertheless, all of the proof incriminates the U.S. government. And all of the actions that were taken by the de facto regime, or the golpista regime, which are those who carried out the coup, and it is to make favor of the industrial policies and the military policies and the financial policies of the United States in Honduras.\nAMY GOODMAN: Was your daughter Pichu in the house?\nMANUEL ZELAYA: [translated] In my house, there were three people. The woman who cleans the house and who works here, and she has 10 years working with us, she is a woman of great trust. And she continues to work here. Her name is Suyapa. She was taken out, and they dragged her by pulling out her hair, because the military, after they captured me, they entered into each one of the rooms, and they broke into the rooms through using their rifle butts, looking for my wife and for my daughter. My daughter is very thin, and so she went underneath the bed. Suyapa, the cleaning lady, she’s a little overweight, and so she could not hide. So they grabbed her by her hair, and they took her away. Pichu, whose real name is Xiomara Hortensia, she hid under the bed, and they didn’t find her.\nAMY GOODMAN: The M-16s, where were they made, that the hooded Honduran soldiers used?\nMANUEL ZELAYA: [translated] All of the arms that the Honduran military uses are U.S. weapons. And the high command of the military of Honduras is trained at the School of the Americas.\nAMY GOODMAN: After the coup, did the U.S. stop the weapons flow to Honduras?\nMANUEL ZELAYA: [translated] This week, there were 85 members of Congress of the United States, they sent a letter to the State Department, Hillary Clinton, and this letter speaks to the necessity of controlling the support, and they speak of paralyzing, which is given to the armed forces of Honduras. And so, they point to the high rates of violations of human rights that take place in Honduras. In other words, after the coup d’état in this country, the U.S. has increased its military support to Honduras.\nAMY GOODMAN: Do you support the call of the Congress members?\nMANUEL ZELAYA: [translated] All who defend human rights and who are against the armaments and war making, they have my support.\nAMY GOODMAN: You say that the coup was a conspiracy. And you talked about the right wing in the United States. Explain exactly what you understand. Who fomented this coup against you?\nMANUEL ZELAYA: [translated] The conspiracy began when I started to join what is ALBA, the Latin American nations with Bolivarian Alternative. So, a dirty war at the psychological level was carried out against me. Otto Reich started this. The ex-Under Secretary of State Roger Noriega, Robert Carmona, and the Arcadia Foundation, created by the CIA, they associated themselves with the right wing, with military groups, and they formed a conspiracy. They argued that I was a communist and that I was attacking the security of the hemisphere, because I’m a friend of Fidel, I’m a friend of Chávez, and I had declared my government as a government which is progressive.\nAMY GOODMAN: And yet, WikiLeaks released that trove of U.S. government cables, and in it was a cable from then-U.S. ambassador — the then-U.S. ambassador to Honduras to the State Department, saying that — I think it was titled “Open and Shut: The Case of the Honduran Coup,” and it was saying it was illegal, it was unconstitutional. It was written by U.S. Ambassador Hugo Llorens.\nMANUEL ZELAYA: [translated] Hugo Llorens cooperated in order to avoid the coup d’état. He knew everything that was happening in Honduras. And I am a witness to the effort that he made to stop the coup. But when he perceived that he could no longer stop it, then he withdrew. I don’t know if he had orders to withdraw, but he allowed everything to happen. He did help my family a great deal after the coup. And I am grateful to him now. He showed me that he is someone who believes in democracy and not in the coups d’état. But a great part of the Pentagon does not believe this, nor does the Southern Command.\nAMY GOODMAN: What does the Southern Command have to do with this?\nMANUEL ZELAYA: [translated] The link that Ambassador Ford, who was the ambassador from the United States before Llorens, he said that I could not have a friendship with Hugo Chávez. He wanted me to give political [asylum] to Posada Carriles. He wanted to name who my ministers of my cabinet of my government should be. He wanted his recommendations to become ministers of my government.\nAMY GOODMAN: Posada Carriles, he wanted him to be able to take refuge in Honduras, the man who was alleged to be the mastermind behind the Cubana bombing that killed scores of people?\nMANUEL ZELAYA: [translated] After eight days of my becoming president of the country, the ambassador, Charles Ford, asked me if I could give political asylum to Posada Carriles in Honduras. And of course, I sent him to outside. He spoke to my foreign minister, my secretary of state, about that — the same ambassador who prohibited me from becoming a member of the ALBA. And this ambassador, who just left Honduras, who left the country with a political profile of myself, the ambassador, Ford, left this letter as a profile of the president, and when you read it, you can tell that it is the precursor of the coup itself. WikiLeaks published this document. They published the profile that Ambassador Ford made of me to give to Hugo Llorens, saying that the United States needs to make decisions about what it will do the following year in order to detain me, because I am tied to narcotrafficking and to terrorism and to many, many other things. So, he prepared the ambiance, situation. And he was transferred from the embassy to the Southern Command. And that is the tie. And if you ask today, where is this Ambassador Ford? He is in the Southern Command. And so, he left here in order to prepare the coup d’état.\nAMY GOODMAN: And yet, the coup d’état took place under President Obama, not before.\nMANUEL ZELAYA: [translated] We’re talking about the United States, so it’s an empire. The United States is an empire, and so Obama is the president of the United States, but he is not the chief of the empire. Even though Obama would be against the coup, the process toward the coup was already moving forward. The most that they tell a president like President Obama, that there’s a political crisis going on. But they do not talk about the details that they were involved in in terms of the conspiracy.\nAMY GOODMAN: President Obama early on called it a coup. But then the administration seemed to back off, both he and Hillary Clinton.\nMANUEL ZELAYA: [translated] They gave themselves up before the coup itself. That is the proof, in fact, that the coup came from the north, from the U.S. So they are even able to bend the arm of the President of the United States, President Obama, and the State Department, and they impeded my restitution as president of the country.\nAMY GOODMAN: Ousted President Manuel Zelaya, sitting in his home in his living room in Tegucigalpa for the first time in 23 months, kidnapped at gunpoint by Honduran soldiers as his daughter Pichu hid under her bed upstairs. He was then flown to Palmerola, the U.S. military base in Honduras, supposedly to refuel, and then on to Costa Rica. It was the first military coup in Latin America in more than a quarter of a century.\nWe leave you today with Zelaya’s address to tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Hondurans upon his arrival home on Saturday.\nMANUEL ZELAYA: [translated] Your presence here this afternoon shows the support of the international community, that the blood was not shed in vain, because we’re still standing, keeping our position valid. Peaceful resistance. Fellows, resistance is today the cry of victory, of the return to Honduras of all the rights and guarantees of the Honduran democracy.\nAMY GOODMAN: Tomorrow, in part two of our interview, President Zelaya will talk about his plans for the future. We’ll also speak with his wife, former First Lady of Honduras Xiomara Castro de Zelaya. We ask her if she plans to run for president next.

Meanwhile, concerns about freedom of expression increased, as seven journalists have been killed in the past three months.\n“President Lobo has publicly committed to human rights but has failed to take action to protect them, which is unacceptable. He needs to show he is serious about ending the climate of repression and insecurity in Honduras – otherwise the future stability of the country will remain in jeopardy,” said Guadalupe Marengo, Amnesty International’s Americas deputy director.\nPresident Lobo was elected in November last year amid a political crisis that saw President Zelaya ousted by military-backed politicians.\nHundreds of people opposed to the coup were beaten and detained by the security forces as protests erupted during the following months. More than 10 people were reportedly killed during the unrest. The police and military also widely misused tear gas and other crowd control equipment.\nHuman rights activists, opposition leaders and judges suffered threats and intimidation, media outlets closed and journalists were censored. There were also reports of security force personnel committing acts of sexual violence against women and girls.\nJudges viewed as critical of the coup suffered a series of arbitrary transferrals and unfair disciplinary proceedings. Members of the organization Judges for Democracy, which promotes principles of fairness and transparency, formed the vast majority of those targeted.\nNo one has yet been held to account for these abuses and few investigations have been opened. Victims continue to wait for justice and reparation for the abuses they endured.\n“It is a sad fact that no redress has been provided to the numerous victims who suffered serious abuses at the hands of the police and military during the de facto government’s time in power,” said Guadalupe Marengo.\n“These grave human rights violations must not be forgotten or go unpunished. Victims have the right to truth, justice and reparation.” \nAmnesty International is also seriously concerned that the number of attacks on journalists has actually risen since the new government came into power. Seven journalists have been killed since March 2010 and many more have suffered threats and harassment.\nMeanwhile, four judges were removed from their posts on 1 June 2010, apparently for criticising the coup d’etat – a move that seriously undermines the justice system.\nThe Honduran government established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission in April but Amnesty International is seriously concerned that its mandate is limited only to establishing the contributing factors to the crisis.  Truth commissions should be one part of a comprehensive national plan devised to protect the rights of victims of human rights violations. In addition to this, the government must ensure investigation, justice and reparation for victims.  \n“Honduras’ coup d’état left the country in need of a programme of human rights reconstruction with clear objectives and a timeline for completion – but the commission lacks a proper mandate or capacity to investigate abuses,” said Guadalupe Marengo.\n“Our past research shows that when insufficient steps are taken to ensure justice and truth, the wounds do not heal and the cycle of violence and unrest continues.” \nBackground\nHonduran President Manuel Zelaya Rosales was forced from power on 28 June 2009 and expelled from the country by a military-backed group of politicians led by Roberto Micheletti, former president of the national Congress.\nAccording to dozens of testimonies collected by Amnesty International’s researchers in Honduras during two visits to the country, human rights abuses spiralled after the coup.\nThe de facto government headed by Micheletti remained in power until the end of 2009. A new government led by Porfirio Lobo took office on 27 January 2010 on the same day Amnesty International released a report titled “Honduras:  Recommendations to the new Honduran government following the coup of June 2009” which documented violations during the coup d’etat\nAmnesty International has continued to urge the authorities to address human rights violations committed after the coup since it came to power, as has the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.\nHONDURAS\nPRESS RELEASE\nPRESS RELEASE\nRelated Content\nCOUNTRY\nHonduras\nNEWS\nHonduras: The state must guarantee truth, justice and reparation for the family of Berta Cáceres\nCAMPAIGNS\nNikole: “I come from the world of technology where there are very few women”\nNEWS\nEl Salvador: Ratification of the constitutional reform deepens the risk of human rights abuses\nNEWS\nHonduras: The presidential candidates have a unique opportunity to commit to human rights\nRecently added\nIsrael/OPT: States must act now to halt Israel’s military takeover of Gaza City as famine officially declared \nSaudi Arabia: Deplorable execution exposes broken promise to halt death penalty for juveniles \nSlovenia: Facilitating the transfer of arms to Israel ‘alarming’ and violates international law\n8 Years On: Accountability needed for Myanmar atrocities against Rohingya\nUSA/Global: Tech made by Palantir and Babel Street pose surveillance threats to pro-Palestine student protestors & migrants  \nDONATE TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS\nTogether we can fight for human rights everywhere.

Coup's Legacy Of Violence\nFEBRUARY 12, 20126:19 AM ET\nHEARD ON WEEKEND EDITION SUNDAY\nBy \nAnnie Murphy\nA soldier guards the area where ousted President Manuel Zelaya was kept after returning to Honduras in 2010.\nEsteban Felix/AP\nThe second of a two-part series about the roots of violence in Honduras.\nHonduras is a major stop for drug traffickers; corruption is rampant. Many experts say things got markedly worse after the 2009 coup that ousted democratically elected President Manuel Zelaya. The fallout of that coup continues today.\n'The Shooting Started Around 5:20 a.m.'\nWhen it comes to coups and dictators, Latin America has a difficult past. Today the region is largely democratic. Dictators and coups are supposed to be a thing of the past.\nHonduras' last dictatorship ended in 1982. The June 2009 coup that ousted Zelaya was a shock to the region and a surprise to world leaders, including Zelaya himself.\nLATIN AMERICA\nPolice Accused Of Corruption, Killings In Honduras\n\"The shooting started around 5:20 a.m. I went downstairs, and there were about 250 masked soldiers around my house,\" he says from his home in Honduras' capital, Tegucigalpa. \"All you could see were their eyes. I said, 'My God, what is this?' \"\nThe military whisked Zelaya out of the country on a tiny plane and left him in Costa Rica.\n\"They took off, and there I was. The democratically elected president of Honduras, standing in my pajamas in the middle of a runway in Costa Rica,\" Zelaya says. \"I said to myself, 'So this is that great new future everyone is talking about for Latin America?' \"\nAfter two years spent in forced exile, he returned home last year as part of negotiations for Honduras' re-entry into the Organization of American States, which it had been kicked out of after the coup.\nThe military coup that ousted Zelaya was ordered by members of Honduras' supreme court and carried out by the military. Zelaya had been pushing for a poll to gauge public interest in rewriting the constitution, and the court ruled it illegal.\nPolice Brutality\nAfter ousting Zelaya, the coup government sent the army and police into the streets. They began arresting, beating and even killing anyone who protested against the new government. According to an official truth commission, they were responsible for at least 20 deaths in the immediate aftermath.\nEdgardo Valeriano, a medical doctor and researcher, had never been political. But after the coup, he joined protests demanding democracy and Zelaya's return. Like many protesters, he was beaten. His skull was split open by batons and police lashed him with chains. Valeriano says he feels like Honduras went back to the 1980s.\n\"I remember those years well. I was a student in medical school back then, and I remember how some students would show up tortured by the police,\" he says. \"Stories on the news about other young people that had been brutally tortured, whose bodies would turn up at different spots in the capital. There was an atmosphere of strong repression.\"\nThe election of Rafael Callejas, who was Honduras' president between 1990 and 1994, marked the first time in 60 years that power was transferred peacefully between two major parties. Callejas says he believes Zelaya is too brash, but says illegally ousting him has had huge repercussions.\n\"We're in a crisis. We went back 20 years. We lost again the issue of democracy,\" Callejas says. \"Who rules in Honduras now? Really? Who rules? The people? The system? Or strength? I mean, that's the question that has to be solved.\"\nZelaya's supporters rallied after the coup that ousted him in June 2009.\nEsteban Felix/AP\nU.S. Reaction To The Coup\nFor more than a century, the U.S. government has had significant influence in Honduras, from the era of U.S.-owned banana plantations, to military and economic ties that endure today. Because of that history, the U.S. response to the 2009 coup carried a lot of weight.\n\"After the coup, a lot of the line taken here by pro-coup people was that the coup was the restoration of democracy, and they sold that in Washington,\" says Fulton Armstrong, a former CIA analyst who worked as a senior staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during the coup. He watched the U.S. response unfold.\n\"But when you look at what was actually happening in Honduras, [Zelaya] really was a continuation of a halting but definitely forward-moving consolidation of democracy,\" he says.\nDespite the call for Zelaya's return by nearly every other country in the hemisphere, Washington chose to back new elections, which were condemned internationally because of widespread violence and repression. Polls were held, and five months after Zelaya's ouster, Porfirio Lobo was elected president. Eventually, the crisis was declared over, but violence has only increased.\nCresencio Arcos, who was ambassador to Honduras in the early '90s, has been involved in the country for decades. He says the Obama administration failed to take a firm position regarding the coup.\n\"I think this stems from the following: that Latin America is an orphan in our foreign policy. I don't think we have a defined policy,\" Arcos says. \"We had one during the Cold War: They were our allies. After the Cold War ended, we never redefined; we never retooled.\"\nDefining The State Of Affairs\nMany here say the outcome of the coup is what pushed Honduras to where it is today: the world's most violent nation, according to the U.N.\nValeriano says it was shocking that in the 21st century, they could pull off a coup. If the president can be taken out of a country and have his rights taken away, the doctor says, without a trial or anything, then what becomes of your average citizen?\nAnnie Murphy is a fellow in the Investigative Reporting Program at the University of California, Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism.\nFacebook\nFlipboard\nEmail\nREAD & LISTEN\nHome\nNews\nCulture\nMusic\nPodcasts & Shows\nCONNECT\nNewsletters\nFacebook\nInstagram\nPress\nPublic Editor\nCorrections\nTranscripts\nContact & Help\nABOUT NPR\nOverview\nDiversity\nNPR Network\nAccessibility\nEthics\nFinances\nGET INVOLVED\nSupport Public Radio\nSponsor NPR\nNPR Careers\nNPR Shop\nNPR Events\nNPR Extra\nterms of use\nprivacy\nyour privacy choices\ntext only\nBy clicking “Accept All Cookies” or continuing, you agree to the use of cookies, similar tracking and storage technologies, and information about your device to enhance your viewing, listening and user experience, personalize content, personalize messages from NPR’s sponsors, provide social media features, and analyze NPR’s traffic.

SELIGSON | AUGUST 5, 2010\nThe diplomatic fallout surrounding the 2009 Honduran coup may be dwindling, but its effect on popular support for democracy may have long-term implications.\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nThreads\nEmail\nShare\nReading Time: 11 minutes\nAn AmericasBarometer Insights Series Report1\nWith Mexico and Chile restoring diplomatic relations with the administration of President Porfirio Lobo this week, many are beginning to hope that the diplomatic fallout surrounding the June 2009 coup in Honduras may be coming to an end.  Unfortunately, based on surveys we have conducted, within Honduras the long-term effects seem far from over.  While a majority of Hondurans believe that events of June 28, 2009 removing then-President Manuel Zelaya were a coup and levels of dissatisfaction with the government that preceded the events have declined, the coup and its outcome appear also to have opened a stark difference between socioeconomic classes and their support for democracy.2 The coup and its resolution appear to have had what we call a cathartic effect for a larger number of upper class Hondurans—decreasing their levels of dissatisfaction with democracy—much more than for poorer Hondurans, whose support for coups is lower than the upper classes.   The risk is that the elites have come to see the removal of the president such as occurred in June 2009 as a legitimate and effective way to vent their opposition to economic policies.\nBackground\nAs early as 2004 Honduras demonstrated “greater risk for unrest, political turmoil, and support for antidemocratic regimes than [did] the other countries,” according to a study by John Booth and Mitchell Seligson using 2004 AmericasBarometer data.  At the time, political legitimacy in Honduras was very low compared to legitimacy levels in its neighbors in Central America.3 This was based on a combination of measurements of satisfaction.  The concept measures levels of satisfaction in three key dimensions of political legitimacy: 1) support for democracy; 2) support for national institutions; and 3) evaluation of the incumbent government’s economic performance.  We combine them and the proportion of citizens who are below the midpoint scale on all three key dimensions of political legitimacy are “triply dissatisfied.”\nProtests against Manuel Zelaya in Honduras, July 2009 (Credit: Roberto Breve/Flickr)\nIn past work, Booth and Seligson compared the proportions of triply dissatisfied versus triply satisfied for each country, which they argued could demonstrate a proclivity toward political stability or unrest. Their theory did not assert that having dissatisfied citizens was in itself a problem for democracy, since disaffection can be healthy for democracy. Rather they argued that the balance of dissatisfied to satisfied citizens is what matters. When times are bad and critics of the system are numerous, a democratic political system also needs supporters who believe in democracy, support the nation’s institutions, and are not overly critical of government economic performance.  Absent that key group of supporters, stability can be placed at risk.\nBooth and Seligson found that in 2004, for every triply satisfied citizen, Honduras had 1.57 triply dissatisfied citizens. In contrast, for every triply dissatisfied Costa Rican there were 12.5 triply satisfied ones.4 We concluded that this strongly suggested that as early as 2004 Honduras demonstrated “greater risk for unrest, political turmoil, and support for antidemocratic regimes than [did] the other countries based on this indicator”\nBy 2008, AmericasBarometer survey data showed that Honduras’ risk of political instability had risen sharply in four years.  The proportion of triply dissatisfied Hondurans went from 12 percent in 2004 to over 31 percent of the voting-age population in 2008, and there were over six times more triply dissatisfied Hondurans than those who were triply satisfied. These survey data from 2008 pointing to growing disaffection among Honduran citizens illuminated the context in which political conflict emerged and boiled over in 2009.  The events leading up to President Zelaya’s ouster, and those of June 28, 2009 have divided Honduran society and generated intense debate about the constitutionality of Zelaya’s policies and the actions taken by the military, Congress, and the courts.\nThe 2010 AmericasBarometer survey in Honduras5 asked a series of questions related to the political crisis.  First, we asked a series of questions to measure attitudes directly related to the political crisis: Did Hondurans in our survey conducted in early 2010 support the ouster of President Zelaya? Did they express support for the policies Zelaya wanted to implement? Did they believe that either president or the Army behaved unconstitutionally?\nIn response to our first question, we find that 58 percent of voting age Hondurans opposed the removal from office of President Zelaya.6 We also wanted to know how Hondurans reacted to Zelaya’s expatriation, an action that is explicitly prohibited by the constitution.7 Probing more deeply, we found that opposition to the exile was even greater, with 72 percent of voting aged respondents in the AmericasBarometer 2010 survey expressing opposition.\nOpponents of President Zelaya and some constitutional scholars have argued that the actions of the military did not in fact constitute a coup d’etat. President Zelaya’s supporters and others say that this was a clear case of an unconstitutional and unjustifiable coup.\nHow did the average Honduran weigh these two positions? The results of the AmericasBarometer survey for 2010 reveal that a majority of Hondurans believe that Zelaya’s removal was indeed a coup. Over 61 percent said the actions taken by the military on June 28 constituted a coup.8 They held to this position even though large majorities also expressed opposition to Zelaya’s intended reforms. Indeed, more than 70 percent of Hondurans were opposed to his proposed constituent assembly (at least in early 2010) and over 75 percent were against the “consulta” that Zelaya had wished to carry out. President Zelaya repeatedly and forcefully denied that his reforms would have included presidential reelection.9 However, the opposition claimed that reelection was the key constitutional change sought by Zelaya and his supporters. This debate between Zelaya and those who supported his ouster notwithstanding, the 2010 AmericasBarometer survey reveals, however, that almost three quarters of Hondurans opposed changing the Honduran constitution to allow for presidential re-election.10\nWhat happened to the triply dissatisfied citizens?\nThe removal of President Zelaya, and the subsequent national elections that took place in November 2009 seem to have been cathartic for the Honduran population in terms of their levels of dissatisfaction with the legitimacy of their political system in the period before the coup. FIGURE 1 shows that by early 2010 the mean national Honduran score on the triple dissatisfaction index had declined substantially from the peak observed in 2008.11 It had dropped from its high of 1.3 in 2008 to 1.0 in 2010. This level was still far higher than that found in neighboring Costa Rica, but among Hondurans it represented a sharp decline from 2008.\nBut what specifically had changed? Had Hondurans become on average more democratic, more institutionally supportive, or happier about the performance of their administration in handling the economy?\nFIGURE 2 breaks down the triple dissatisfaction index into its components and follows them over time. It reveals that discontent was quite widespread in 2008. That year levels of support for regime institutions, support for democratic principles, and evaluation of regime economic performance were at or near their lowest observed levels in this time series. FIGURE 2 also reveals a recovery of each of these components of regime legitimacy in 2010 after the coup. Support for democratic principles recovered slightly between 2008 and 2010. Support for economic performance, by far the lowest component of triple dissatisfaction, rose modestly from 2008 to 2010 but remained low (not surprisingly, given the global economic slowdown and the particular problems faced by Honduras as foreign assistance and some foreign investment were reduced after the coup). The evaluation that improved the most was support for institutions, which increased roughly 15 scale points from before to after the coup.\nFigure 1. Mean Levels of Triple Dissatisfaction\nFigure 2.  Components of the triple dissatisfaction index in Honduras, over time.\nWhat were the sources of citizen dissatisfaction with government in Honduras?\nOLS regression analysis indicates that demographics had an evolving impact on the levels of triply dissatisfied respondents over time. What stands out in this analysis is that the better off were less dissatisfied in 2004 and 2010, but not in 2006 and 2008.  That indicates that rich and poor alike were triply dissatisfied in the years immediately prior to the 2009 coup, while after the coup the rich returned to their position of 2004 of being significantly more triply satisfied than other Hondurans [See Table 1].12\nTable 1. Predictors of levels of triple dissatisfaction in Honduras, by year*\nVariables T-scores\n2004 2006 2008 2010\n(Constant)\n16.054 12.164 13.336 15.061\nWealth\n-2.510 -1.899 1.408 -4.012\nAge\n2.099 0.757 -1.825 1.300\nEducation\n-0.679 -1.873 -3.206 1.647\nFemale\n0.588 1.609 0.861 -0.428\nSize of Community of residence\n3.151 1.717 – 1.387 3.012\n* Shading indicates statistical significance.\nAnalyzing further the connection between wealth and the triple dissatisfaction indicator provides evidence of the extent to which “satisfaction” with the Honduran regime is rooted in social class differences.\nFirst, FIGURE 3 clearly reveals the dramatic surge in triple dissatisfaction from 2006 to 2008, followed by an almost as large decline from 2008 to 2010.  For 2006 and 2010 mean triple dissatisfaction levels were generally lower as income quintiles rose. For 2008, however, a distinctive curvilinear relationship appears, with lower and higher incomes showing less dissatisfaction than middle income respondents. This reinforces the evidence in Table 1 suggesting a shift in the class basis of dissatisfaction with regime economic performance.  Specifically, middle quintile citizens showed much higher triple dissatisfaction than in 2006 or than they would later in 2010. Something clearly happened between 2006 and 2008.\nFigure 3. Triple dissatisfaction levels by year and levels of wealth\nWhat was the relationship between Hondurans’ economic class position and their satisfaction/dissatisfaction with the regime in 2010, some 8 months after the coup? Looking at the three components of the triple dissatisfaction measure, FIGURE 4 indicates that one, citizens’ evaluations of regime economic performance, was closely linked to economic class standing. In 2010, with the new administration in power, elites were more supportive of the economic performance of the regime than those in lower wealth quintiles. Elites also expressed far more support for coups than Hondurans in lower income quintiles, which suggests that the coup may have proved satisfactory to the interests of wealthier Hondurans.\nFigure 4. Legitimacy norms and coup justification in 2010, by levels of wealth\nWhat demographic factors determine support for coups?13\nThe regression analysis shown in FIGURE 5 indicates that wealth and education were significant determinants of support for coups in 2010. Wealthier Hondurans expressed higher support for coups, while Hondurans with lower levels of education expressed higher support for coups. These results suggest a combination of low education and high wealth may be lethal for democracy in Honduras, and perhaps elsewhere.\nFigure 5. Determinants of Support for Coups, 2010\nFIGURE 6 reveals higher support for coups in 2008 (the blue bars) than in 2006 (the green bars), indicating a rise in displeasure with the Zelaya administration. As in FIGURE 3, we also observe curvilinear effects. In 2006, support for coups was substantially elevated among Hondurans in the middle quintiles of income, and the pattern was similar in 2008. For 2010 (the red bars), however, we observe a precipitous pattern change — a great drop in coup justification from 2008 for all wealth quintiles. Other patterns are worth noting. By 2010 the curvilinear patterns of coup justification by wealth level seen in 2006 and 2008 had disappeared. The wealth-coup justification relationship had become linear and positive. In 2010—following the coup of 2009—support for coups had declined substantially from 2008, from about 51 to 36, for the wealthiest, and from 44 to 23, for the poorest. That still left the wealthiest Hondurans with the highest levels of coup justification and the smallest decline in this attitude of any quintile from 2008, again suggesting that elite interests may have been far better served by the coup than those of lower strata.\nThere are various ways to interpret this overall decline in coup support. One is that a “catharsis” or some purging of pent up emotions could indeed have occurred. Another is to speculate that Hondurans, upon reflection on the coup’s costs (increased domestic conflict and repression, external opprobrium, economic assistance cuts), may have changed their minds about how good an idea a coup might be.\nFIGURE 6 also reveals that everyone except the poorest supported a coup more in 2008 than in 2006. The biggest changes occurred among those in the top quintile or the wealthiest, whose support for coups went from 36.8 in 2006 to 51.5 on the 0–100 scale in 2008. However, every wealth group reduced its coup support between 2008 and 2010. The largest decreases seem to be among the middle classes.\nFigure 6. Justification of Military Coups by Wealth Quintiles by Year\nConclusion\nAfter the tumultuous events of 2009, most Hondurans perceived the events as a coup and opposed both the coup and President Zelaya’s exile from Honduras. However, large majorities nevertheless reported opposing Zelaya’s attempted “consulta” and his proposal for a constituent assembly.\nIn the wake of the coup, support for institutions rose sharply and evaluation of economic performance increased as well.  Hondurans’ support for democratic regime principles, however, by 2010 had recovered very little of the ground lost between 2006 and 2008. This indicates that support for basic democratic principles remain at the levels prior to the coup, thus representing a continued potential threat to stable democratic governance.  Between 2008 and 2010 support for coups among the wealthiest cohort of Hondurans declined the least of any economic group. And in 2010 the wealthiest cohort remained the most coup-justifying segment of the Honduran citizenry.\nDemocratic consolidation is often described as a condition that prevails once citizens and elites of a nation have a generalized embrace of democratic norms and a commitment to constitutional democratic rules as the “only game in town.” Whatever cathartic effect the 2009 coup may have had, or whatever second thoughts citizens may have had about what took place, coup justification remained highest among the best-off Hondurans in 2010 in the wake of months of political trauma, protest, violence, repression and international condemnation. The findings of the 2010 AmericasBarometer survey in Honduras offer little evidence that Hondurans, and especially Honduran elites, view democracy as “the only game in town.”\nFootnotes\n1.

Funding for the AmericasBarometer has mainly come from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Important sources of additional support were also the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and Vanderbilt University.\n4. This is calculated by dividing 1.0 by the .08 ratio, which yields 12.5\n5. The 2010 sample consists of 1,596 interviews selected using multi-stage stratified sampling design to represent nine different geographic regions of Honduras. Random selection proportional to size was used at all stages, except at the household level where quotas for age and gender were used to select the adults to be interviewed. The sample in each stratum closely approximates the underlying population distribution of Honduras. The margin of error for a sample of this size is ±2.5% at the 95% confidence interval.\n6. Respondents were asked: “¿Estuvo usted de acuerdo con la destitución del Presidente Zelaya?\n(1) Sí  (2) No”, which in English means: “Were you in agreement with the removal from office of President Zelaya?”\n7. Respondents were asked: “¿Estuvo usted de acuerdo con el envío al exilio del Presidente Zelaya? (1) Sí (2) No,” which in English means, “Were you in agreement with the sending into exile of President Zelaya?”\n8. The question asked was: “¿Considera usted que la destitución del Presidente Zelaya, en Junio del 2009, fue un golpe de estado?(1) Sí (2) No,” which in English reads: “Do you think that the removal from office of President Zelaya, in June, 2009, was a coup d’etat?”\n9. Note that the constitution itself absolutely prohibits changing the no-reelection provision, one of the “inviolable” clauses (artículos pétreos).\n10. The question read: “¿Está usted de acuerdo con reformar la Constitución para permitir la re-elección presidencial? (1) Sí  (2) No,” which in English means: “Are you in agreement to amend the constitution to permit presidential re-elections?”\n11. The survey was conducted in early 2010, seven months after Zelaya’s ouster. Just a month before the survey took place was the inauguration of the new president, Porfirio Lobo, who had been chosen in the regularly scheduled presidential election of November 2009.\n12. Other findings from the regression analysis are: First, respondent education levels mattered little. Second, the size of one’s community of residence mattered for triple dissatisfaction in 2004 and 2010, with larger communities likely to have more disgruntled people. In 2006 and 2008, however, triple dissatisfaction was present in all sizes of communities. Finally, sex and age had little to do with shaping triple dissatisfaction over time. This evidence shows that during Zelaya’s administration citizens’ frustrations became generalized by urban geography and wealth prior to the 2009 coup, but afterward returned to prior patterns (urbanites and the poor more triply dissatisfied).\n13. Scale composed of items tapping the following hypothetical situations:  “When there is high unemployment, when there is a lot of crime, or when there is a lot of corruption (1) A military take-over would be justified (2) A military take-over would not be justified.” The scale is measured on a 0-100 metric.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nOrlando J.

Criminal investigations into Hernández and others in his circle loom over the race, with some suggesting the government will do whatever it takes to ensure the ruling National Party stays in power. Recent piecemeal electoral reforms also offer little in the way of ensuring a clean election in November. Still, experts believe the opposition stands a chance, especially after Salvador Nasralla, a TV personality who finished second in the 2017 election, ended his candidacy and backed former first last Xiomara Castro. The alliance was seen as a step toward a more unified front against the National Party.\nBelow, AQ profiles Castro, as well as the National Party’s Nasry Asfura and the Liberal Party’s Yani Rosenthal, who each won party primaries in March.\nThe election is scheduled for November 28, 2021. Whoever gets the most votes in the one-round election will win the presidency.\nAQ also asked a dozen nonpartisan experts on Honduras to help us identify where each candidate stands on two spectrums: left wing versus right wing, and nationalist versus globalist. The results are mapped on charts below. We’ve published the average response, with a caveat: Platforms evolve, and so do candidates.\nWe will occasionally update this page to reflect developments in the campaigns, including the rise of new contenders.\nNasry Asfura | Xiomara Castro | Yani Rosenthal\nNasry\nAsfura\n62, mayor of Tegucigalpa\nNational Party\n“I have absolutely nothing to hide.”\nHOW HE GOT HERE\nA veteran of the National Party with ties to President Hernández, Nasry “Tito” Asfura had a career in local politics and served as a deputy in Congress before becoming mayor of the capital, Tegucigalpa, in 2014. His time as mayor has been marked by messy urban growth – he has won popularity through infrastructure projects, but the city has lost some 400 trees during his tenure.\nWHY HE MIGHT WIN\nAsfura is a seasoned politician who is well liked by constituents in the capital and even critics admit he’s charming. The National Party, meanwhile, operates as a well-oiled machine in Honduras’ urban peripheries and rural areas. In the case of a close election, some analysts believe the party could manipulate vote counts to push Asfura over the top.\nWHY HE MIGHT LOSE\nOngoing investigations in the U.S. into President Hernández stand to alienate the National Party among middle class voters, and Asfura himself is under investigation for embezzling over $1 million in city funds as mayor. Some say he has also not done enough to help the capital confront a severe water shortage.\nAsfura could also lose if opposition voters break for a single candidate. The National Party only won the past two elections with a minority of the vote in amid a split opposition. History also isn’t on his side: No single party has managed to win the presidency for a fourth consecutive term since Honduras transitioned from military rule in 1982.\nWHO SUPPORTS HIM\nAsfura draws his support from public employees, top brass in the military and police forces, residents of Tegucigalpa, evangelical voters, and business elites, especially those who have benefited from investments he has facilitated as mayor. The National Party’s record of clientelism also strengthens his support among poor and rural voters.\nWHAT HE WOULD DO\nAsfura is the status quo candidate in this year’s election. He is likely to continue his predecessor’s efforts to try to make Honduras more friendly to foreign investment. But he may also seek to shield National Party officials, including Hernández, from prosecution over corruption allegations – something that could alienate the new administration in the United States, Honduras’ biggest investor.\nIDEOLOGY\nReturn to list of candidates\nXiomara\nCastro\n61, former presidential candidate and wife of former President Manuel Zelaya\nLiberty and Refoundation (LIBRE)\n“The time has come for a woman to take the reins of this country.”\nHOW SHE GOT HERE\nXiomara Castro de Zelaya led the movement protesting the 2009 coup that deposed her husband, former President Manuel Zelaya. Formerly of the Liberal Party, the Zelayas founded their own party, LIBRE, in 2011. Castro’s second-place finish as LIBRE’s candidate in the 2013 presidential race signaled a shift away from the two-party system long dominated by the Liberal and National parties. During his presidency, Zelaya moved to the left in step with similar shifts in the region at the time.\nWHY SHE MIGHT WIN\nVoters may remember the decline in poverty during her husband’s presidency – a trend that reversed after the coup. Her party has established a strong presence in rural areas, which may help stave off attempts at fraud, experts tell AQ, and she has made an effort to build support within the private sector. Polling in first and second in some polls, she may draw votes from opposition voters who want to support whoever has the best chance of beating the National Party’s Asfura. On October 13, opposition figure and TV personality Salvador Nasralla ended his own candidacy and backed Castro – a game changer for Castro, analysts told AQ. \nWHY SHE MIGHT LOSE\nThe Zelayas’ ties to the late Hugo Chávez of Venezuela are likely to scare independent voters. The only woman in the race, she is also subject to sexist stereotypes and accusations that she is just a proxy for her husband, who brings baggage to her candidacy. On March 11, an ex-leader of a drug trafficking clan testified in a U.S. court that he paid $500,000 in bribes to then-President Zelaya in 2006.\nWHO SUPPORTS HER\nLIBRE is a big tent party representing a range of ideologies. It includes former Liberal Party members, rural farmers, labor leaders and public university students. In addition to supporters of Nasralla who may heed his calls to vote for Castro, voters from the Liberal Party, which was Castro’s original political party before the Zelayas founded LIBRE, may break for Castro as their candidate’s chances dwindle.\nWHAT SHE WOULD DO\nCastro has stated that she would “immediately open diplomatic and commercial relations with mainland China.” She promotes an alternative economic system to free-market capitalism and would likely push for a constituent assembly to rewrite Honduras’ constitution as well as a UN-backed anti-corruption commission. She is vocal in her opposition to ZEDES, the semi-autonomous free trade zones pushed by the Hernández government. Read more about the outlook of a Castro presidency. \nIDEOLOGY\nReturn to list of candidates\nYani\nRosenthal\n55, businessman, former government minister, convicted money launderer\nLiberal Party\n“Hondurans understand that my case wasn’t just. I don’t feel that they look at me with stigma.”\nHOW HE GOT HERE\nYani Rosenthal is a businessman who comes from one of Honduras’ richest and most powerful families: His father was a vice president, a congressman, four-time presidential candidate, and the founder of the Continental Group, a conglomerate of businesses. Rosenthal has a long history of Liberal Party politics, having served as a deputy in Congress and later as a top minister to President Manuel Zelaya. In 2017, Rosenthal was sentenced to three years in U.S. prison for laundering drug money, a sentence he completed in 2020, just in time to run for president.\nWHY HE MIGHT WIN\nRosenthal is a known figure who inherits support from his father, but his chances for a victory look increasingly slim as the election approaches.\nWHY HE MIGHT LOSE\nThe Liberal Party has lost its momentum in recent elections, and internal divisions could hurt Rosenthal’s chances — primary opponent and party president Luis Zelaya has said he would never support him. Ultimately, a convicted felon who is sanctioned by the U.S. and can’t travel there faces serious challenges in becoming a competitive candidate for the presidency.\nWHO SUPPORTS HIM\nPeople from San Pedro Sula and business elites who support the Liberal Party because of a family history of support, among others.\nWHAT HE WOULD DO\nIf he can eke out a win, he’s expected to pursue business-friendly policies and avoid making changes to the constitution. He has promised to try to halt migration by creating jobs and said he would call for a referendum to allow voters to decide on the legality of abortion, same-sex marriage and drugs. Even if he loses, his ties to the Zelayas, and his party’s likely representation in Congress, means he could be play a key role in drumming up support for Castro’s agenda, should she win.\nIDEOLOGY\nReturn to list of candidates\n\n\nTags: Elections 2021, Honduras\nLike what you've read?

Call\nDecember 4, 2017\n10 min read\nOrder from Chaos\nRead more from\nOrder from Chaos\nAmidst delayed and suspicious election results last week, Honduras is facing its biggest political crisis since a 2009 coup ousted its president. The crisis and the underlying issues are emblematic of many of the challenges facing democracy in Latin America, and highlight the need for a more concerted international strategic response if democracy is not to be eroded in the near future.\nThe crisis, explained\nThe current crisis began with the Sunday, November 26 elections for president, Congress, and municipal governments. Most polls showed the sitting president Juan Orlando Hernandez ahead by double digits, and people expected the results to be announced by that evening (as has been the norm since democratization in 1980). A law-and-order candidate of the conservative National Party, Hernandez has purged 30 percent of the police force, many for corruption, and brought Honduras’ homicide rate down from 79 per 100,000 in 2013—the highest in the world—to 42 in 2017. He has overseen GDP growth rates of over 3 percent annually, albeit with a drop in much-needed foreign investment.\nPolling stations around the country send the ballots to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (Tribunal Supremo Electoral, or TSE) on Election Day, but suspicions spread as the day passed without results. At 1:45am, the TSE finally issued preliminary results based on 57 percent of the polling stations. The results showed anti-corruption candidate, Salvador Nasralla, ahead of the sitting president Juan Orlando Hernandez by 5 percentage points. Observers inside and outside Honduras concluded that the election had produced a historic upset.\nNasralla, a former Pepsi executive and sports TV announcer, had capitalized on a 2015 wave of outrage against government corruption. Top officials of the Honduran Social Security Institute were found to have stolen over $300 million, some of which funded Hernandez’s 2013 presidential campaign. Los indignados—the “outraged”—had taken to the streets across the country to demand the president’s resignation. To weather the crisis, he agreed to create a mission of the Organization of American States (OAS)—the Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH), staffed by international professionals to help prosecute and investigate corruption cases.\nBased on exit polls of a firm owned by one of his close advisers, the president declared victory Sunday night. So did Nasralla. The president said that lagging rural returns favored him over the urban polls. Late Monday afternoon, the TSE finally announced that it would not update results until the last voting box was brought to the capital, likely Thursday. The third-place candidate of the Liberal party, which had alternated power with the governing National Party since 1980, conceded and congratulated the upstart Nasralla on his victory. TSE substitute magistrate Marco Ramiro Lobo said Monday afternoon that, based on what he had seen, the lead was “irreversible.” The opposition celebrated in the streets, and the media speculated on how Nasralla would govern.\nOn Tuesday, the TSE started to update its figures, showing the sitting president gaining on Nasralla. On Wednesday, Hernandez pulled ahead, and by Monday December 4 was up by 1.6 percent with 99.96 percent of the vote counted, even as the opposition demanded a review and recounts. The OAS and EU election monitoring missions appealed for calm until all the results were in on Wednesday, and sought assurances that the candidates would respect the TSE findings. Nasralla agreed, but quickly reneged after the vote counting system mysteriously went down for five hours.\nSince the mysterious delay began—inexplicable, since the TSE received the results (if not the actual ballot boxes) from all the polling stations around the country within a day of the vote—opposition parties and journalists have criticized the long and strange silence. Analysts speculated that the delay by the TSE—itself seen as biased with pro-government members—was designed to buy time for the ruling party to rig the outcome. In fact, October tape recordings that The Economist obtained revealed plans by the governing party to skew the election (known as “Plan B”).\nAs of today, the TSE is welcoming continued and direct international observation. However, the country now faces a possible extended governance crisis, potentially involving widespread violence. On Wednesday, November 29, one NGO reported anti-fraud protests in 16 of Honduras’ 18 departments, and fires and rock-throwing occurred in the capital.  Riot police responded to some of these protests with tear gas and beatings. On Friday, December 1, the government suspended some constitutional guarantees in the face of spreading protests, including a nighttime curfew for 10 days. Eleven people have reportedly been killed in election-related protests.\nSupporters of Salvador Nasralla, presidential candidate for the Opposition Alliance Against the Dictatorship, clash with riot police as they wait for official presidential election results in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, November 30, 2017. REUTERS/Edgard Garrido.\nHonduras and Latin American trends\nWhat does this electoral crisis tell us about the state of democracy in the region?\nIronically, the election process exhibits some of the more hopeful recent developments in Latin America. The surprising strength of the vote for an anti-corruption candidate reflects a new intolerance for corrupt behavior. From trials of top politicians in Brazil, to Guatemalan protesters’ success in reversing attempts at preserving impunity, to the prosecution of ex-presidents in Peru and El Salvador (connected to Brazil’s multinational “Car Wash” scandal), people are showing increasing outrage over “business as usual” politics of buying favors, fixing contracts, stymieing investigations, and purchasing judges. After the “Central America Spring” of 2015, when tens of thousands of outraged anti-corruption protesters forced out Guatemala’s president and threatened Hernandez’s rule in Honduras, many wondered whether its impact was ephemeral. On Monday it was apparent that the effect of that outrage persists, and was not captured in the pre-election polls.\nHonduras’ experience since 2014 also shows the continued influence of people power on the streets of Latin America. Even as the United States and Europe contend with their own internal setbacks to liberal democracy, and are less inclined to advocate for political reforms abroad, Latin Americans are demonstrating the capacity to combine popular protests with institutional reforms to solidify their long quest for more inclusive and less corrupt governance.\nThe region has also made strides in transparency and accountability. For the first time in Honduran history, this election involved transmission of polling place results directly to the political parties at the same time as to the TSE. This practice created what some believed (and what may yet prove) to be a helpful check on manipulation of the vote tallies.\nIn addition, the initial achievements of the OAS’ MACCIH mission indicate governments’ greater willingness to work with intrusive international bodies that bring extra expertise but also outside protection and legitimacy to checks and balances. MACCIH helped the attorney general convict the ex-director of the Honduran Social Security Institute and two vice ministers involved in a scandal there. In the past year, the mission contributed to securing the longest sentence ever handed down for corruption to a Honduran ex-official, and the first sentence handed to any Honduran official for influence peddling.\nBut the electoral crisis also reveals some worrisome trends in the region. Even before the election, President Hernandez exhibited some of the same behavior that has undermined the quality of democracy in the region. In 2012, when he presided over the Congress, he engineered the replacement of four of the five justices of the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court with handpicked appointees. As president, he and his party also arranged to appoint a new attorney general and a Supreme Audit Court that was seen as pliable to partisan interests (though the attorney general has shown some independence, with MACCIH’s support). Like the Chávez  and Maduro governments of Venezuela—and consonant with similar efforts in Bolivia and Ecuador—Hernandez attained control over all branches of government. Questions about this election as others in the region (and in the United States) could well undercut faith in elections generally and make people less inclined to vote.\nHernandez also took a step that governments of Venezuela, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Bolivia have sought: changing the constitution to permit longer tenure in office. Although these moves have been constitutional, they have all involved rigged use of institutions. In a move widely seen as unconstitutional, Hernandez’s appointees on the constitutional court annulled a constitutional ban on reelection of the president, permitting his current reelection effort. This move outraged the opposition because it was the mere suggestion of such a change that led to the coup whereby the military bundled then-President Zelaya up in his pajamas and sent him out of the country in 2009—with the support of Hernandez’s National Party. The leftist opposition generally refers to Hernandez’s administration as “the dictatorship.” His victory could embolden political figures in the region with authoritarian tendencies, such as Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro.\nHernandez’s government and perhaps the current questionable behavior around the elections also demonstrate that the shadow of corruption continues to be long and strong. The “Plan B” incident is one example. Another relates to hearings in the New York trial of a leading Honduran drug trafficker, which led to allegations that the president—his brother—and top officials of the current government had taken bribes from cartels. Investigations are ongoing in the United States and in Honduras.\nThe National Party’s “Plan B” show how parties and officials that have undertaken “anti-corruption” measures that show some real results can persist in corrupt behavior. Real blows against corruption may not transform thoroughly institutionalized corrupt systems. The 2015, ouster of Guatemala’s President Otto Perez led to the election of an anti-corruption candidate who is now accused of corrupt behavior. It remains to be seen whether the mass prosecutions in Brazil are transforming the corrupt political system.\nWhat should be done?\nHondurans are pressing for a transparent final vote recount and review of the electoral process and tally. The EU and the OAS should be supported in continuing their presence on the ground until a satisfactory process is completed. The Trump administration and Congress should freeze aid to Honduras until OAS and EU observers are satisfied with the recount and the process.\nIn the medium term, further reform of the campaign finance system and tighter implementation of a 2016 “Clean Politics” law may institutionalize fairer and more transparent campaign practices. An independent TSE, citizen polling observers alongside party representatives, and a second round of voting could enhance the process. And as long as the attorney general continues to push investigations of high-level corruption, continued external support for the OAS MACCIH mission can enhance the capacity and political space to eventually purge corruption from social expectations and political practices. External support will be necessary for internal reformers and pressures to attain political systems that enjoy the confidence of their populations.\nRELATED CONTENT\nWhat will be Raúl Castro’s legacy?\nWhat will be Raúl Castro’s legacy?\nHow will global geopolitics affect Latin America’s next electoral cycle?\nHow will global geopolitics affect Latin America’s next electoral cycle?\nLatin America’s super election cycle is wide open\nLatin America’s super election cycle is wide open\nAUTHOR\nCharles T.

At least 17 people have died in protests amid opposition allegations of election fraud.\nOpposition candidate Salvador Nasralla is in Washington DC and is meeting the US State Department, the OAS and non-governmental organisations to present what he called “numerous” pieces of evidence of alleged fraud.\nAccording to the court’s official count, Hernández won with 42.95% to 41.42% for runner-up Nasralla who had challenged the result well before the announcement and said he would not recognise it.\nCrisis of Honduras democracy has roots in US tacit support for 2009 coup\nRead more\nThere was no immediate public comment by Hernández, whose sister Hilda Hernández, a cabinet minister, died on Saturday in a helicopter crash.\nInterviewed by UneTV during a layover at Miami airport, Nasralla said Hernández’s re-election was not legitimate. “The declaration by the court is a mockery because it tramples the will of the people,” Nasralla said. He added that “the people do not endorse fraud”.\nAn EU election observer mission has noted issues with the Honduran system that could have favoured Hernández, including disparity of resources and media time, selling of party credentials at voting tables to ensure greater presence of his National party and social programmes that “blurred the line between government and ruling party”. The mission noted that several of these problems were covered in its 2013 report, and that no changes had been made for these elections.\nAlmagro said via Twitter shortly before Matamoros’s announcement that election observers had concluded that “serious doubts persist about the results”. He asked that no “irresponsible pronouncements” be made before observers could deliver their definitive reports.\nQ&A\nHow have you been affected by the events in Honduras?\nShow\n\nAfter the 26 November poll, the first results reported by the electoral court before dawn the next day showed Nasralla with a significant lead over Hernández with nearly 60% of the vote counted.\nPublic updates of the count then mysteriously stopped for more than a day and, when they resumed, Nasralla’s lead was steadily eroded and ultimately reversed in Hernández’s favour.\nThe electoral court recently conducted a recount of ballot boxes with irregularities and said there was virtually no change to its count. Since then, it has been considering challenges filed by candidates.\nDespite widespread suspicions of electoral wrongdoing, Matamoros defended the court’s performance. He said it had presided over “the most transparent electoral process ever seen in Honduras”.\nHernández, a 49-year-old businessman and former lawmaker, took office in January 2014 and built support largely on a reduction in violence in the impoverished Central American country.\nAccording to Honduras’s National Autonomous University, the nation’s homicide rate has fallen from 91.6 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2011 to 59 per 100,000 — though it remains among the deadliest places in the world.\nCorruption and drug trafficking allegations have cast a shadow over his government, and his re-election bid fuelled charges that his National party was seeking to entrench itself in power by getting a court ruling to allow him to seek a second term.\nThousands protest in Honduras in chaos over contested presidential election\nRead more\nRe-election has long been outlawed in the country, and in 2009 the then-president, Manuel Zelaya, was ousted in a coup ostensibly because he wanted to run again.\nZelaya, who founded the Alliance party that Nasralla was representing, was critical of the president on Sunday.\n“The people say: ‘You are not our president’,” Zelaya tweeted. “We must mobilise immediately to all public places. They are violating the will of the PEOPLE.”\nHernández’s government recently accused Zelaya and Nasralla of ordering “gangs” to block streets and commit violent acts amid the protests, during which barricades have been burned and clashes taken place between rock-throwing demonstrators and police, with soldiers responding with teargas.\n“The generalised crisis that Honduras is experiencing is primarily due to the disagreement there has been between the political parties which, in a democracy, must respect the majority will of the people expressed at the ballot box,” the national human rights commissioner, Roberto Herrera, said in a statement.\nZelaya has called for protests on Monday, and the Liberal party has called for protests on Tuesday, after conceding to Nasralla.\nRodolfo Pastor, an Alliance spokesman, told the Guardian: “We will continue to fight against this fraudulent election process.”\nAssociated Press and Reuters contributed to this report\nExplore more on these topics\nHonduras\nAmericas\nnews\nShare\nReuse this content\nMost viewed\nWorld\nEurope\nUS news\nAmericas\nAsia\nAustralia\nMiddle East\nAfrica\nInequality\nNews\nOpinion\nSport\nCulture\nLifestyle\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning\nSign up for our email\nHelp\nComplaints & corrections\nSecureDrop\nWork for us\n Privacy policy\nCookie policy\nTerms & conditions\nContact us\nAll topics\nAll writers\nDigital newspaper archive\nTax strategy\nFacebook\nYouTube\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nNewsletters\nAdvertise with us\nSearch UK jobs\nTips\nAccessibility settings\nBack to top\n© 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

    "full_text": "Accessibility links\nSearch\nAMERICAS\nHonduran President Likely to Be Re-Elected in Disputed Vote\nNovember 26, 2017 11:03 AM\nBy Associated Press\nBanners with a portrait of Honduran President and current presidential candidate Juan Orlando Hernandez hang outside a polling station during the general elections in Tegucigalpa, Nov. 26, 2017.\nTEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS — \nHonduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, a conservative U.S. ally, appeared likely to win a second term on Sunday despite opposition claims that his re-election is an unconstitutional power grab.\nHernandez's popularity is based largely on a drop in violence in the impoverished Central American country, whose homicide rate was once among the world's worst. Honduras' National Autonomous University says the rate has dropped to 59 homicides per 100,000 from a dizzying high of 91.6 in 2011.\nBut corruption and drug trafficking allegations have cast a shadow over his government, and his re-election bid has fueled charges that his conservative National Party has trampled the country's institutions in a bid to entrench itself in power.\nFears of just that sort of consolidation - but by a leftist rival allied with Venezuela - led Hernandez's party to back a military coup in 2009 against a president it accused of plotting to violate Honduras' seemingly iron-clad constitutional ban on re-election.\nThe country's highest court backed the 2009 ouster of President Manuel Zelaya. But the current court is packed with Hernandez' supporters and it ruled in 2015 that the constitutional ban was inferior to a citizen's right to seek re-election, a decision that infuriated opposition leaders.\n\"Here in Honduras there is no democracy; there is a dictatorship,\" Zelaya told The Associated Press late Saturday. \"The hypocrisy of the Honduran elite is evident ... the people will have to decide at the ballot box.\" Now a leader of the main opposition alliance, he warned of possible irregularities in the vote.\nHernandez has used the military to help crack down on crime since taking office four years ago, and his campaign website boasts of praise from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who has lauded Hernandez \"for his leadership in addressing security and governance challenges.\"\nThe president also has reached out to evangelical Christians and warned that his rivals would carry Honduras toward a Venezuelan-style crisis - alluding to the fact Zelaya had been backed by the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.\n\"God our Lord is with us, and we would not do anything without his divine protection,\" Hernandez said in a final campaign video posted on his Facebook page.\n\"We will take a step forward to confront those who seek chaos and those who, allied with foreign forces, try to drag us to a system that has brought only pain and suffering to other societies,\" he added.\nThe 15th of 17 children, Hernandez was born in a small, mountain city in western Honduras. He attended a military school, studied law at the national university and says he obtained a master's degree in public administration from the State University of New York. He was the head of Congress before winning the presidency in 2013 elections.\nIn addition to people in Honduras, tens of thousands of Hondurans were eligible to cast ballots in seven U.S. cities: Atlanta, New Orleans, New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston and Washington.\nSunday's general elections are the tenth in Honduras since the country returned to democracy in 1980 after almost two decades of military regimes.\nThe leftist Opposition Alliance Against Dictatorship is running television host Salvador Nasralla, while the traditional Liberal Party is running Luis Zelaya, a middle-of-the-road candidate. There are another six candidates from tiny opposition parties, but the president remains the clear front-runner.\nOne issue that could hurt Hernandez is the perception of corruption.\nA convicted drug trafficker testified in a New York courtroom this year that he met with Hernandez' brother Antonio to get the Central American country's government to pay its debts to a company that the trafficker's cartel used to launder money.\nDevis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, ex-leader of the cartel known the Cachiros, testified that Antonio Hernandez asked him for a bribe in exchange for government contracts. The brother has denied that allegation.\nAnd in September, the son of a former president from Hernandez's party, Porfirio Lobo was sentenced in New York to 24 years in prison after revealing his role in a cocaine trafficking conspiracy.

Food insecurity and malnutrition are driven by climate change, uneven economic growth, rising inequality, violence, displacement and limited access to basic services.\nThe economic impact of the double burden of malnutrition – undernutrition and overweight/obesity – is estimated at US$618 million annually (from 2018 to 2081), equivalent to 2.7 percent of GDP. \nDespite progress in reducing stunting, 19 percent of children under 5 still experience developmental delays due to malnutrition. Micronutrient deficiencies remain widespread, and overweight and obesity are rising among women of reproductive age.\nIn 2024, Honduras faced prolonged droughts, erratic rainfall, economic instability and inflation, severely affecting agriculture and household incomes – especially in rural and marginalized communities. Women, children, and Indigenous and Afro-descendant populations were hardest hit. These challenges have continued into 2025, with ongoing climate shocks impacting food production and water access.\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) supports the Government in improving nutrition for vulnerable groups, strengthening smallholder farmers’ resilience, promoting climate-smart agriculture and supporting the National School Feeding Programme. WFP also assists families affected by sudden and slow-onset crises, aiming to reduce food insecurity and enhance national risk management capacity.\nWhat the World Food Programme is doing in Honduras\nEmergency preparedness and response\nWFP provides life-saving food assistance to complement government responses to sudden and slow-onset disasters.

    "full_text": "Select Language\nHonduras Walks an Economic Tightrope. What Happens to the Americas?\nBy Olav A. Dirkmaat\nAP\nLost in the 2024 election shuffle, Honduras is walking an economic tightrope. Faced with an unprecedented currency crisis, the country’s response may shape the economic future of Central America for better or worse, with real consequences for the United States that cannot be overlooked.\nThe Honduran currency, the lempira, is weakening dramatically despite the government’s efforts to maintain its value artificially. This Sisyphean task has come at a considerable cost in recent months, with the Honduran government burning through more than $2 billion in foreign currency reserves as a way of buoying the lempira against the U.S. dollar. \nWhile the IMF’s involvement is well-intentioned and designed to stabilize government finances, the inflationary risk associated with Washington, D.C.’s involvement is all too real. If hundreds of millions of dollars suddenly flood the Honduran economy, working people in the country should expect extreme inflationary pressure. As the late economist Milton Friedman once observed, “Inflation is one form of taxation that can be imposed without legislation.”\nCase in point: The United States. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve printed trillions of dollars to stabilize the situation, and Americans are still dealing with sky-high inflation today. In Honduras' neighbor, Guatemala, inflation reached almost 10 percent in 2022.\nThere is no free lunch, and Honduras’ policymakers must understand the unintended consequences of accepting IMF financial assistance. The urgency of their fiscal situation is underscored by a looming debt repayment schedule. With numerous bonds maturing, debt service is projected to exceed $4 billion annually between 2022 and 2026—a staggering 23 percent of the country’s annual government budget. This financial pressure cooker forces policymakers to make difficult choices between maintaining currency stability and meeting debt obligations.\nIn the months ahead, Honduras’ ability to balance competing priorities will be crucial. The government’s artificial propping up of the lempira may provide short-term stability, but at the cost of depleting reserves and potentially triggering longer-term economic pitfalls.\nIf the economic crisis worsens, U.S. onlookers should brace for spillover effects. After all, nearly 30 percent of Hondurans are in need of humanitarian aid, and growing numbers are forced to move and seek refuge outside the country’s borders. Honduras is a transit country for people traveling to the U.S., with thousands of migrants entering Honduras’ borders every day and hundreds of thousands per year. A worsening economy could very well lead to a massive uptick of Hondurans themselves seeking refuge elsewhere, most notably the U.S.\nThe population of Honduras may be under 10 million, but the small Central American nation has an outsized impact on regional economic prospects and the region’s very own relationship with the United States. The decisions made in the coming months won’t just determine the fate of Hondurans for years to come, but they will also affect Honduras’ neighbors that are deeply interconnected in a volatile global economy.\nWill Honduras stick the landing, or is an economic catastrophe on the horizon? Only time will tell. But, for policymakers, investors, and economists around the world, it will be essential viewing.\nOlav A.

While advanced economies suffered a severe recession during the 2008–09 financial crisis in the United States and western Europe, followed by a weak recovery, emerging market economies were seen as the promise for renewed world economic growth. Latin America was viewed as part of that promise.\nThe 2004–13 decade was, in many ways, exceptional in terms of economic growth and even more so in social progress in Latin America. Some analysts came to refer to the period as the “Latin American decade,” a term coined to contrast with the “lost decade” of the 1980s, when a massive debt crisis sent the region into severe recession.\nBut this positive picture has changed dramatically. Growth per capita ground to a halt in 2014 and much of the region is again viewed with a sense of forgone promise. The sudden deterioration in the region’s prospects also reflects significant changes in the international factors that affect the region’s economic performance—including a substantial decline in commodity prices, which remain the backbone of the region’s (and particularly of South America’s) exports—and an overall moderation of global trade. If Latin America is to regain its footing, it must undertake reforms to diversify economies and to upgrade technologically its production structure to make it less dependent on the behavior of commodities.\nGood performance\nAlthough 2004 marked the start of the so-called Latin American decade, some economic improvements had begun years before. Low fiscal deficits have been the rule in most countries since the 1990s. A strengthening of the tax bases facilitated a well-financed expansion of social spending, which had severely contracted during the 1980s. Inflation, which for the region was nearly 1,200 percent in 1990, had fallen to single digits by 2001. These are all significant achievements. But the most remarkable one, given the precedent of the debt crisis, has been the sharp reduction in the ratio of external debt to GDP that took place during 2004–08. At the same time, countries in the region accumulated large foreign exchange reserves. External debt net of foreign exchange reserves fell from an average of 28.6 percent of GDP during 1998–2002 to 5.7 percent in 2008 (see Chart 1). Although the downward trend was interrupted in 2008, when the region ceased to run the current account surpluses it had been enjoying since 2003, it was still low by historical standards in 2014—only 8 percent.\nBecause low debt ratios make it more likely that a nation can pay its borrowings on time, they have permitted most Latin American countries extraordinary access to external financing. In the mid-2000s, real (after-inflation) interest rates on Latin American external borrowing returned to low levels the region had not seen since the second half of the 1970s, before the devastating debt crisis that led to the lost decade. Because of the prudent debt ratios, monetary authorities in several countries were able to undertake expansionary policies to counter the adverse effects of the strong recession in advanced economies. In particular, all major central banks reduced their interest rates, and several governments increased public sector spending to expand domestic demand. This ability to conduct economic policies that counteracted the business cycle rather than reinforced it was unprecedented in the region’s history.\nEconomic growth averaged 5.2 percent from 2004 through the middle of 2008, the best the region had experienced since 1968–74 (see Chart 2). Moreover, it was accompanied by an investment boom in many countries. Investment as a percentage of GDP increased to levels that were only slightly below the peak reached prior to the 1980s debt crisis—and higher if Brazil and Venezuela are excluded.\nAnd after a brief and sharp slowdown in economic growth in 2009—which was a full-blown recession in some countries, notably Mexico—growth recovered to average 4.1 percent a year in 2010–13. For most countries, the truly exceptional growth occurred from 2004 to mid-2008, although a few countries—Panama, Peru, and Uruguay—did experience a full decade in which their economies grew at average annual rates of over 6 percent from 2004 to 2013.\nSince the 1990s, the region has also experienced long-term improvements in human development thanks to an increase in social spending as a proportion of GDP in all countries. The increased social spending facilitated the expansion of education, health, and other social services. These improvements can be characterized as a “democratic dividend,” because they followed the broad-based return to democracy in Latin America in the 1980s.\nMost notable among the beneficial social changes during the past decade was a large reduction in poverty and related improvements in labor markets and income distribution. According to data from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and the International Labour Organization, regional unemployment fell from 11.3 percent in 2003 to 6.2 percent in 2013. Employment in the informal sector—in which workers labor in low-productivity activities, either independently or in very small firms—fell from 48.3 percent of total employment in 2002 to 44.0 percent 2014, and the portion of the population aged 15 to 64 with jobs increased by 4.6 percentage points.\nThere was also a remarkable improvement in income distribution in most Latin American countries—not only a contrast with the region’s history, but also a divergence from the relatively generalized global increase in inequality in recent years (see “Most Unequal on Earth,” in this issue of F&D). This narrowing of inequality combined with economic growth resulted in a spectacular reduction in poverty levels and a rise of the middle class. In 2002, the percentage of the Latin American population living in poverty was higher than in 1980, according to ECLAC (2014) data. But the poverty headcount declined by 16 percentage points over the ensuing decade; about half of it represented a reduction in extreme poverty. The only comparable reduction in poverty levels took place in the 1970s, thanks to rapid economic growth at the time. As poverty fell, the middle class (people living on incomes between $10 and $50 a day, according to the World Bank definition) grew from about 23 percent to 34 percent of the population.\nStill, these social improvements must be viewed with caution. Labor market informality still predominates in many countries. Improvements in income distribution were for the most part a reversal of the growing inequality during the 1980s and 1990s. And even with the improvements in inequality, Latin America continues to have among the worst income distribution in the world. Furthermore, the increase in availability of education and health care has not been matched by improvements in quality of the services. For example, Latin American students rank low in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Programme for International Student Assessment. High-quality education is essential to develop the technologically sophisticated areas that produce the high-value goods and services essential to a return to dynamic growth in Latin America.\nGood times end\nIn contrast to the halcyon decade that ended in 2013, the recent economic performance of Latin America has been poor. Growth fell sharply in 2014 to just 1.1 percent—barely above the region’s current low population growth of 1.0 percent—and will continue at a similar or even lower rate in 2015, according to both the IMF and ECLAC (see Chart 2). Investment also declined in 2014, and will continue to do so in 2015. Poverty ratios have stagnated at 2012 levels (see Chart 3) and, although no hard data are yet available, this seems also true of income distribution. Unemployment has remained low, but the proportion of the working-age population with jobs fell in 2014.\nThere are, however, significant regional differences in recent developments in Latin America. The sharp slowdown is essentially a phenomenon in South America, which grew 0.6 percent in 2014 compared with 2.5 percent in Mexico and Central America. Furthermore, Venezuela started a severe recession in 2014, which will deepen in 2015, and the two largest South American economies, Argentina and Brazil, will also experience moderate recessions in 2015, according to the IMF (2015). Most other South American countries have continued to grow but experienced a slowdown in 2014 (Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay) or are experiencing one in 2015 (Colombia). The exceptions are Bolivia and Paraguay, which will continue to grow at 4.0 percent or more in 2015. In the northern part of the region, Mexico will grow, although at a somewhat lackluster rate—2.1 percent in 2014 and a projected 3.0 percent in 2015. That continues the mediocre pattern for the northernmost Latin American economy, which grew at an average rate of 2.6 percent between 2004 and 2013, the second lowest rate in Latin America. Thus, in northern Latin America, it is Central America (with the exception of El Salvador and Honduras) and the Dominican Republic that outperform.\nAlthough some strengths remain, the region is less able than it was in 2008 and 2009 to counteract adverse external shocks, such as the decline in commodity prices or changes in U.S. monetary policy.\nA major strength for the region continues to be low external debt ratios. Although they have started to increase, the debt ratios, net of foreign exchange reserves, remain low. With some exceptions, this favorable net debt position gives countries access to private capital markets and, at a minimum, permits most monetary authorities to avoid contractionary policies when managing the current shocks. But, because of rising external imbalances (especially a deficit in the current account) and in some cases rising inflation, the room for monetary authorities to maneuver is more limited than what they enjoyed during the 2008–09 financial crisis. Indeed, some—notably Brazil—have been forced to increase interest rates to counteract rising inflation. On top of this, higher government spending in recent years has constrained Latin America’s ability to use fiscal policy to support growth in economies hit by declining international demand. On average, the region has ceased to run the primary fiscal surpluses (income minus spending before interest payments) that it enjoyed before the crisis.\nThe greatest risk comes, however, from the current account of the balance of payments. Despite the very favorable terms of trade (export prices relative to import prices), the region has been running deficits on its current account (which largely measures the difference between exports and imports of goods and services, or equivalently how much aggregate spending exceeds the value of national income). One way to understand this is to subtract from the current account the gains in export values generated by improvements in the terms of trade relative to a pre–commodity boom year (2003). Estimated in this way, better terms of trade benefited Latin America at the equivalent of about 7 percent of GDP in 2011–13. But the region not only spent all those gains, it ran a current account deficit. This means that the region in fact overspent the commodity boom (see Chart 4). Other estimates (IMF, 2013) suggest even greater overspending. Recent depreciations of many of the region’s currencies will eventually help reduce current account deficits (by making exports more profitable and imports more expensive). But in the short term, improvements in the current account will come primarily from lower imports, the result of the economic slowdown.\nOutside influence\nThe change in Latin America’s fortunes results in large part from a reversal of the benevolent external conditions that fostered the boom. The excellent performance from 2004 until the middle of 2008 reflected the extraordinary coincidence of four positive external factors: rapid growth of international trade, booming commodity prices, ample access to external financing, and migration opportunities and the burgeoning remittances that migrants sent home.\nTwo of these positive factors—migration opportunities and rapid world trade expansion—have disappeared, probably permanently, as a result of the financial crisis in advanced economies.\nMigration opportunities to the United States are more limited than before the crisis, and high unemployment in Spain has prompted many South American migrants to return home. Remittances, which help prop up demand in recipient countries, have recovered but are still below the 2008 peak.\nLikewise, world trade experienced the worst peacetime contraction in history after the September 2008 collapse of the Wall Street investment firm Lehman Brothers. Although trade swiftly recovered, since 2011 it has settled in at a slow rate of growth. Overall, according to IMF data, export volumes have increased only 3.0 percent a year since 2007, the worst performance since World War II and a fraction of the 7.3 percent annual growth rate registered between 1986 and 2007.\nThe commodity price boom took off in 2004 and, although the rise was interrupted by the sharp contraction in international trade, recovery was also very fast. The benefits of the positive terms of trade were particularly strong for energy- and mineral-exporting economies (Venezuela, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador, in that order), followed by the major agricultural exporters (Argentina and Brazil). In contrast, oil-importing countries were hurt, notably those in Central America and the Caribbean.\nBut when non-oil commodity prices started to fall in 2012 and oil prices collapsed in the second half of 2014, fortunes were reversed. The recent losers have been the energy and mineral-exporting economies that benefited from the boom, while Central American countries are now winners. The economic slowdown in China is a major reason for the commodity implosion, as Chinese demand has been the major determinant of commodity prices. Unanswered is whether this is a short- or long-term phenomenon. My research with Bilge Erten (Erten and Ocampo, 2013) indicates that real commodity prices have followed long-term cycles since the late 19th century. If this continues to be the pattern, the world is at the beginning of a long period of weakening commodity prices.\nTherefore, of the four conditions that fed the 2004 to mid-2008 boom, only one remains in place: good access to external financing. The reverberations from the Lehman collapse essentially shut down financing from private capital markets, but only for about a year. Latin American access to international capital markets rebounded sharply after that. Annual bond issues by Latin America have almost tripled—to $9.6 billion a month in 2010–14 compared with $3.5 billion in 2004–07—and the costs of financing have remained low for countries that issued bonds in international private capital markets. The favorable financing climate is the result of low debt ratios and the large amount of liquidity (cash) floating around global financial markets as a result of the expansionary monetary policies of major developed economies seeking to boost their still weak economies (see “Watching the Tide” and “Spill Over” in this issue of F&D). The euro crisis of 2011–12, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s gradual tapering of its bond purchases, and even the commodity shocks of 2014 have had only small effects on Latin America’s access to global financial markets. Moreover, the few countries that lack access to global private capital markets—Argentina, Ecuador, and Venezuela—have had ample financing from China. Global financial conditions may, of course, change given new uncertainties surrounding the euro area in the face of the Greek crisis or if a reversal of U.S. monetary policy draws away investment funds from the region. But at the time of writing, Latin America’s access to global capital markets remained favorable.\nGoing forward\nLatin America cannot rely solely on favorable external conditions to propel economic growth in the near future, but must build up favorable conditions on its own. Hence the need for reforms.\nBut the reforms must go beyond traditional market approaches that were in fashion in the 1980s and 1990s. The stubborn fact is that market reforms have not delivered strong economic growth. Indeed, GDP growth during 1991–2014, after market reforms, was 3.2 percent a year, compared with 5.5 percent during the era of more active state intervention, from 1946 to 1980. Poor productivity has hampered economic performance, and the growth that has occurred has been unstable.\nA basic explanation for this mediocre long-term economic performance is a lack of adequate attention to upgrading technology in the production sector, strong deindustrialization, and the fact that the region has specialized in goods (notably commodities) that offer limited opportunities for diversification and improvements in product quality. This has been reinforced by growing trade with China, which almost entirely imports natural-resource-based goods from Latin America. The net result of relying on traditional export opportunities is a wider technology gap, not only in relation to the dynamic Asian economies, but also with developed natural-resource-intensive economies such as Australia, Canada, and Finland.\nIt is essential, then, that the region invest in diversifying its production structure and place technological change at the center of long-term development strategies. This should include not only reindustrialization but, equally important, the upgrading of natural-resource-production technology and the development of modern services. Diversifying trade with China away from commodities is another essential element of this policy. The need to focus on new technology to increase competitiveness is critical given the prospects of weak growth in world trade.\nBut increased exports are not the only avenue the region should travel. Reduced poverty and a larger middle class provide opportunities for domestic markets as well. The best way to exploit richer domestic markets is through regional integration. But this requires, in turn, overcoming the significant political divisions that have blocked the advance of regional integration over the past decade. In particular, after strong growth in intraregional trade in the 1990s within the two major South American integration processes—MERCOSUR, which initially included Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, and the Andean Community of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru—performance has been rather lackluster (see “Doing It Right” in this issue of F&D).\nIn macroeconomic terms, the most important condition for more dynamic production diversification is more competitive and less volatile real exchange rates. This should be part of a stronger shift toward macroeconomic policies to lean against booms and growth slowdowns and reduce the growth volatility that characterized the past quarter century.\nThe region also needs to make major advances in two other areas: the quality of education and infrastructure investment. Without better education, bottlenecks in the supply of well-trained workers will hold back the technological advancement the region needs. In turn, the weak infrastructure requires significantly higher investment in highways, ports, and airports—at least doubling current investment levels, according to the Development Bank of Latin America (2014). Such investments should make use of public-private partnerships but also—and even more—call for a larger injection of public sector funds.\nThis reform agenda must be put in place. It is not a question of market reforms—the meaning that “reforms” usually has in the policy debate—but of a better mix between states and markets. And, of course, that mix must also consolidate and advance social progress, the region’s most important achievement over the past decade. ■\nJosé Antonio Ocampo is a Professor at Columbia University and Chair of the United Nations Economic and Social Council’s Committee for Development Policy.

Economies grew smartly and there was a significant reduction in poverty and a slight improvement in income distribution—with only a small setback during the Great Recession that began in 2008. But even with these positive developments, poverty, inequality, and economic and social marginalization remain prevalent in many Latin American countries—which historically have had among the most skewed income distribution in the world.\nThe improvements reflect not only strong economic growth in the region, which averaged more than 4 percent during the period, but also better social policies and an increase in the number of workers toiling in the formal economy rather than the less-productive underground, so-called informal, economy, where wages and social protection are weaker.\nMoreover, better monetary, spending, and tax policies—as well as strong demand for commodities key to the region’s economies—enabled Latin American countries in the main to weather the global crisis better than advanced economies. In the past, worldwide downturns generally sent Latin American economies reeling—and poverty rates skyrocketing. This time the reduction in poverty recorded in the boom years before the crisis continued into 2010.\nDespite sharp variation from country to country, poverty rates for the region as a whole dropped significantly between 2002 and 2008. On average, 44 percent of Latin American citizens were unable to satisfy basic nutritional and non-nutritional needs in 2002; by 2008 that number had fallen to 33 percent (see Chart 1). Moreover, indigence—the level below which people cannot satisfy their food needs—also declined markedly, from about 19 percent in 2002 to less than 13 percent in 2008.\nLike poverty, income inequality has also declined in most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean during the early years of the 21st century. If the so-called Gini coefficient is used to measure how equally incomes are distributed, 15 out of 18 economies surveyed in the region—Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela—experienced improved income distribution (see Chart 2). In at least 11 of these economies the improvement was larger than 5 percentage points. Only in Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, and Guatemala did wealthier segments of society increase their share of total income. The Gini coefficient ranges between zero and 1. In an economy in which one person has all the income, the coefficient is 1. It is zero when everyone has the same income.\nBut income distribution in the region remains heavily skewed. The average per capita income of households in the upper 10 percent is about 17 times that of the poorest 40 percent, a slight improvement over 2002, when it was 20 times higher. So a number of households may have escaped poverty, but they are not benefiting much from economic growth. That should come as no surprise. Poverty, although endemic, responds much more to economic cycles than income distribution. Lack of income equity is a long-standing condition that reflects serious problems of social stratification and wealth inequality that have been handed down from generation to generation.\nThe improvements in poverty and income distribution are explained in large part by growth and government policies and the interaction between them. Many economies in the region have made significant efforts to increase the resources available to implement social policies. On average, social spending rose from 12.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) during 1990–91 to 18 percent of GDP during 2007–08. As a share of overall public spending, social programs grew from 45 percent to 65 percent.\nAmong key social policies, conditional transfer programs, which pay households that engage in socially useful behavior such as keeping children in school, have also helped improve income distribution and reduce poverty. Other important programs include unemployment insurance, recruitment subsidies, and job creation programs.\nLatin America was largely untouched by the first phase of the global crisis, which severely roiled financial markets in Europe and the United States. But the financial crisis spread to the real economy—which produces goods and services—and world trade shriveled in late 2008 and early 2009. Latin American output, as measured by GDP, fell 1.9 percent in 2009—the biggest annual contraction in two decades. But unlike during previous crises, many governments were able to undertake policies to mitigate the effects of the downturn on their citizens. Social policies became part of the effort—along with countercyclical taxing, spending, and monetary policies—that governments in the region took to soften the negative economic and social effects of the global crisis.\nThe generalized recovery in 2010 for most Latin American and Caribbean countries—led to a great extent by the adoption of countercyclical policies combined with improving conditions in the global economy—is expected to improve social conditions further. According to the latest estimates by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), the region’s poverty rate rose a tiny bit (from 33 percent to 33.1 percent) in 2009 and is expected to have declined a full percentage point in 2010, to 32.1 percent. Extreme poverty, which rose 0.4 percentage point in 2009, is expected to have fallen back to its 2008 level of 12.9 percent.\nIn addition to economic growth and better social policies, changes in labor markets helped reduce poverty and income inequality. In many countries jobs in the formal sector increased, which, together with rising hourly wages, helped lower-income households relatively more than better-off households.\nAs encouraging as the improvements were, structural constraints could significantly hamper future improvements in overall economic welfare.\n• Despite the recent movement of some workers from the informal to the formal sector, informal employment remains prevalent. Informal jobs, by their nature, are designed to remain out of sight and are seldom as productive as jobs in the formal sector. The productivity gap between the formal and informal sectors leads to wage differentials and inequality. Moreover, because informal employers often do not pay social security taxes, their workers usually are not as well protected as workers in the formal sector, leaving many people with inadequate health insurance and old-age protection.\n• The unequal distribution of financial assets and real assets means that much of Latin American society is poorly equipped to weather economic and social instability.\n• Less access to health and education by poorer people makes it harder to even out income distribution.\nAll these problems contribute to the region’s continued structural productivity gaps—both within countries and compared with the rest of the world (see “Face-to-Face with Productivity” in this issue of F&D). That pervasive lagging productivity translates into low-paying employment and transmits poverty and inequality from generation to generation in a vicious cycle that is hard to break.\nTo deal with these structural issues, ECLAC has proposed a comprehensive development strategy to eradicate poverty and inequality. It places equality at the center of development.­ It establishes a vital role for government and calls for public-private partnership in the setting of economic and social policies.\nECLAC identifies three interlinked policies in its approach to production: industrial policy that focuses on the most innovative sectors, technology policy that increases and disseminates know-how, and policies to support small and medium-sized enterprises.\nEmployment, social, and education policies are at the core of the equality agenda. Labor policy alone does not generate employment, but it can help countries adapt to new conditions in the global market with fiscally and socially responsible economic protection for workers.\nSocial equality and economic growth are not necessarily at odds: the great challenge is to find ways they can reinforce each other. ■\nAlicia Bárcena is the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.\nReferences:\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), 2010, Time for Equality: Closing Gaps, Opening Trails (Santiago, Chile).\n———, 2010, Social Panorama of Latin America 2010 (Santiago, Chile).\nArchive of F&D Issues\nF&D on Facebook\nSubscribe to RSS\nWrite to us\nF&D welcomes comments and brief letters, a selection of which are posted under Letters to the Editor.

Choloma and nearby towns are the center of sweatshop production for U.S. brands in factories called maquilas. They are also the epicenter of COVID-19 in Honduras.\nThe workers blocking the road that morning burned tires, put up barricades, and demanded the government give them the food they had been promised. A worker demonstrating in Choluteca in southern Honduras told the Honduran media outlet UNE-TV, “They told us they’d be here at seven this morning with food, but no one came. We’re hungry. There are 70 villages waiting for food.”\nProtest in Choloma, Honduras. Photo: Honduras Solidarity Network.\nSince mid-March hundreds of thousands of workers in these towns have been laid off as clothing manufacturers Hanes, Gildan, and Fruit of the Loom and auto parts maker Empire Electronics, among others, announced two- to four-month shutdowns. A few maquilas are calling some workers back to make medical equipment.\nIn some unionized factories, workers got two weeks’ pay as severance. Other workers got their accumulated vacation pay and nothing more.\nMaria Luisa Regalado is the director of CODEMUH, the Honduran Women’s Collective, an organization that focuses on the occupational diseases of women maquila workers. She summed up what she’d heard from workers: “We’re scared to lose our jobs…but we feel impotent. Those of us who are renters don’t know how we’ll pay the rent. There’s a lot that’s unknown. We don’t know what’s going to happen with our lives.”\nMeanwhile, Hondurans in the U.S. are having trouble sending remittances back, since many have lost their jobs. Remittances normally make up 20 percent of the Honduran GDP.\nDisaster Capitalism\nThe Honduran government’s response to the pandemic is a textbook example of how the rich and powerful use a crisis to grab and profit as much as they can through undemocratic means. Of course, “disaster capitalism” isn’t new in Honduras, whose people have faced shock after shock since the 2009 coup backed by the Obama administration.\nThe military overthrew a popular constitutional government and introduced the politics of privatization of everything, including the rivers. There have been massive corruption and state-sponsored drug trafficking as well.\nSince post-coup President Pepe Lobo announced Honduras was open for business in 2011, a torrent of voracious multinationals have set up low-wage shops, hydroelectric dams, and mining projects. The 2013 general election and the unconstitutional 2017 re-election of President Juan Orlando Hernandez, commonly called JOH, were both stolen.\nSince then Honduras has devolved into a complete narco-state. JOH’s brother, Tony, was convicted last year in a New York City court of large-scale narco-trafficking and JOH is an unindicted co-conspirator. Of course, that hasn’t stopped the Trump administration from maintaining full support for the corrupt administration.\nThe result today: 63 percent of Hondurans live in poverty (up from 47 percent before the 2009 coup), half of them in extreme poverty. Seventy percent of Hondurans depend on the informal economy — such as farmers markets and driving mini-cabs — to make ends meet.\nThe notorious caravans of Hondurans fleeing north to the U.S. in the last few years were a direct result of the economic devastation of working people, the corruption, and the terror of living in a narco-state.\nNo one believes the government will use the $420 million to rebuild the health care system. It, like so many millions in U.S. aid, will end up in the accounts of corrupt officials.\nCorruption and Dictatorship\nJOH closed the country’s borders on March 15 (except to deportees from the U.S.), imposed an absolute curfew, and suspended fundamental constitutional rights, including the right to freedom of expression, private property, freedom of circulation, and habeas corpus, allowing indefinite detention.\nThe military and the police set up checkpoints across all major boulevards and roads around the country and forcibly closed public street markets, tear-gassing some who resisted. Public transportation was suspended. Authorities detained thousands, including long-time dissidents. Hundreds of people caught driving had their vehicles confiscated with no way to retrieve them.\nDeclaring an absolute curfew in a country with such harsh political and living conditions and with no social safety net makes life impossible for Hondurans. COFADEH, the Committee of the Relatives of the Detained and Disappeared in Honduras, a human rights organization, claimed: “A curfew can’t be obeyed when people are dying of hunger.”\nHealth Care Disaster\n“Destroy, then privatize” is a classic disaster capitalism strategy, which now means the Honduran health care system is completely unprepared to face the pandemic.\nThe destruction and privatization of the health care system began in 2013 when JOH’s National Party stole $350 million from the Social Security system, which provides for health care and pensions, in part to finance his campaign. What followed was the stripping of hospitals of essential supplies and maintenance funds.\nThen a 2016 law undermined the national health care system for workers, a victory that had been won after a strike of banana workers in 1954. The new law laid the framework for an eventual gutting of universal health coverage for workers, forcing them to obtain health care from private vendors at much higher out-of-pocket costs. It was met with widespread protest by labor federations and social movements.\nNow the government has approved $888 million to confront COVID-19, after requesting millions of dollars to fight the virus from international financial institutions like the World Bank, the Inter American Development Bank, and the Central American Bank for Economic Integration. Many fear this money will be diverted to corrupt officials.\nThen the Congress, a few days before the lockdown, earmarked $420 million of the $888 million to implement the “Special Law for Economic Acceleration and Social Protection.”\nThe law intends to build more than 90 hospitals around the country to confront the COVID-19 crisis but hands the administration of public hospitals to the private health care industry. This law, together with its 2016 predecessor, transfers workers’ collective health care coverage currently under the Honduran Institute for Social Security to a for-profit system run by private providers.\nNo one in Honduras believes the government will use the $420 million to rebuild the health care system. It, like so many millions in U.S. aid, will end up in the accounts of corrupt officials while projects the money is supposed to fund are built only on paper.\nAccording to long-time union leader Carlos H. Reyes of the bottling union STIBYS: “The majority of Honduran people and analysts think that the money is being saved for a future electoral fraud to maintain the dictatorship that is sustained by corruption and drug trafficking.”\nSuyapa Figueroa, president of the Honduran Medical College, told CNN that the Honduran “health care system had collapsed” even before the first 150 COVID-19 cases were confirmed.\nNot surprisingly, the curfew and privatization were greeted by a strike of health care workers, who immediately walked off the job to protest lack of personal protective equipment and basic supplies. Many now are working without adequate protection.\nFate of Jobs and Collective Contracts\nAt first many of the maquilas that produce clothing for the North American market refused to suspend operations. Despite the government lockdown, workers were expected to defy the curfew and show up, then work without PPE or social distancing measures. The department of Cortes — the center of maquila work — quickly became the breeding ground for the virus, and workers began to walk off the job in protest.\nAs of this writing there are a questionable 400 cases and 27 deaths in the country, but given the lack of testing, the impossibility of social distancing, and the gathering of hundreds to protest hunger, that number is likely much higher and rising. To date, a doctor who worked in Gildan and two Hanes Brand workers in the city of Villanueva have died from COVID-19.\nNow more than three weeks since the lockdown, most of the maquilas have shut down, leaving workers high and dry. Some, however, are producing medical masks and gowns and remain open. In some cases, there have been reports that companies are suspending permanent, collective work contracts and replacing their existing workforce with workers contracted under the Temporary Labor Law.\nUnder this law, passed following the 2009 coup, employers can hire temps for three months with no benefits. Previously, jobs were permanent, and workers could only be fired for cause.\nBusinesses in other sectors are union-busting as well. Members of STIBYS who work for SAB Miller, Coca Cola, InBev, and Pepsi are still on the job — beer and soft drinks are being treated like essential industries. Many members are refusing to work until they get PPE; in response, companies are firing them and hiring temps.\n‘Not a Single Step Backwards’\nThe extreme lockdown measures with no government assistance and next-to-no social safety net have forced many Hondurans into the streets. Sparked by indignation, hunger, and outright rejection of the corrupt government, many communities across the country have defied the lockdown, organized protests, and blocked roads. They are demanding food assistance for all, not just allies of the ruling party, from the $888 million approved for the crisis.\nThe Honduran social movements, including human rights organizations, indigenous communities, and dozens of other movements, are demanding that the government put the Honduran Medical College and public health experts in charge of handling the crisis, not state security forces.\nThey are also demanding labor and salary guarantees for public and private workers, an end to labor violations by employers, and freedom for political prisoners.\nThey are calling for “hours of noise” and “pot-banging sessions” (cacerolazos) each evening, asking people to make noise from the confines of their homes to demonstrate their rejection of the government’s actions.\nOriginally published by Labor Notes.\nKaren Spring is a Honduras Solidarity Network coordinator based in Tegucigalpa.

She announced that the United States will restore aid to Honduras. From left the leaders are: Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez, Honduran President Porfirio Lobo Sosa, Costa Rica's President Oscar Arias, Secretary Clinton, Guatemala's President Alvaro Colom, Belize's Prime Minister Dean Oliver Barrow, El Salvador's President Carlos Mauricio Funes, and Alberto Vallarino Minister of Economy and Finance of Panama.\nBy Chrissie Long Correspondent\nMarch 05, 2010, 3:20 p.m. ET\n|\nSAN JOSÉ, COSTA RICA\nSix months after the US cut aid to Honduras following its refusal to reinstate ousted leader Manuel Zelaya, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a first step toward normalizing relations with Honduras this week when she announced the United States would be restoring $37 million in aid.\n“We think it’s time to move forward and ensure that such disruptions of democracy do not and cannot happen in the future,” Secretary Clinton said at a meeting of foreign ministers in Costa Rica on Thursday. “Honduras has taken important and necessary steps and they deserve the recognition and normalization of relations.”\nThe announcement comes at a time when most of Latin America continues to reject the legitimacy of the current government. Honduras was not invited to a recent gathering of heads of state at the Rio summit in Mexico and its membership in the Organization of American States (OAS) has yet to be restored.\n\n“The decision made by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is something very positive,” says Jaime Daremblum, a Latin American expert at the Washington-based Hudson Institute. “It’s the first step in something that is long overdue.\nThe US had cut off a portion of economic assistance to the interim Honduras government in September and threatened to slash more if there wasn’t a return to democratic, constitutional governance. It also limited visas for Honduran citizens.\nThe biggest loser in the Honduras crisis? The economy.\nWhen the US and a handful of other international organizations first announced the aid suspensions as a way to pressure Honduras into a peace accord, they came under heavy criticism and were accused of injuring a population that was already among the poorest in the hemisphere.\n\n“This is a country that has paid a big price,” says Michael Shifter, a political analyst at the Inter-American Dialogue, a center for policy analysis in Washington. “One shouldn’t underestimate the cost of diplomatic isolation. This was a blow, not only financially, but also psychologically.”\n\n“The country has been set back and now they’ll have to play catch-up,” he adds.\nNew leader's election catalyst for restoring aid\nThe election of wealthy landowner and seasoned politician Porfirio Lobo served as a catalyst for the restoration of aid. In February, the World Bank announced it would restore a $270 million loan and add $120 million in additional funds, following Lobo’s inauguration.\n\n“The election was … found to be free, fair, and legitimate,” Clinton said during a press conference at the Hotel Intercontinental in San José. “We believe that President Lobo and his administration have taken the steps necessary to restore democracy.”\n\nClinton chose a unique location to make the announcement, as Costa Rica was where former president Manuel Zelaya landed when he was marched out of his home at gunpoint in June. It’s also where he returned for the mediation talks, conducted by Nobel Peace Prize recipient and Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. And the nation’s capital – San José – provided the name for the peace agreement that regional leaders hoped would bring a restoration of constitutional order to Honduras.\n\nSince Lobo’s election in November, Mr. Arias has been an outspoken supporter of reintegration of Honduras – a somewhat lone voice among his Latin American comrades.\n\n“The Honduran people have been punished enough,” he said. “They can’t be punished more … I think the logical thing to do is to turn the page and analyze the possibilities of diplomatically recognizing a new government.”\nOthers likely to follow US lead\nArias expressed confidence during a meeting with Mr. Lobo in December that it would only be a matter of time before his colleagues in the region would accept Lobo’s legitimacy.\n\nThat confidence was echoed by Shifter. “There is a growing interest in trying to get this issue settled,\" he said in a recent telephone interview. \"I think other countries are going to gradually get on board. They don’t want to continue to isolate and punish Honduras.”\n\nShifter, who expects Honduras will be invited back into the OAS before the general assembly in June, anticipates the only resistance to full acceptance into the international community will come from Venezuela and other ALBA nations, who were ardent supporters of ousted president Zelaya.\"\n\nThe US, which has vacillated between over-involvement and absenteeism in the Honduras crisis, made the right move by being one of the first in the region to work toward reintegrating the small Central American country, Shifter says.\n\n“During the Honduran crisis, the United States could have been more involved and thus avoided some of the fallout,” he says. “But what the US is doing now makes sense. This is the job of diplomacy.”\n\nAs to the delay in Latin America’s recognition of the new Honduran government, Clinton said, “Other countries in the region say they want to wait a while [to normalize relations]. I don’t know what they are waiting for, but that is their right to wait.”\n[Editor's note: The original version of the summary for this story misstated the country in which Secretary Clinton made her announcement Friday.]\nFollow us on Twitter and Facebook.\nRelated stories\nHonduras – All coverage\nBriefing: Was Zelaya's ouster a coup?\nThe big loser in the Honduras political crisis?

Both the Manipur state and central governments should take prompt measures to resolve disputes, investigate abuses, and appropriately punish those responsible.\nArmed groups from the predominantly Christian Kuki-Zo community and the mostly Hindu Meitei community have engaged in deadly violence, which has reportedly killed at least 11 people. Students and others have protested the violence, and some have clashed with security forces and attacked government buildings. On September 10, 2024, the Manipur state government imposed a curfew in three districts and suspended the internet in five districts until September 15.\n“The state government’s response to increasingly violent ethnic clashes in Manipur has just caused greater harm,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Right Watch. “Instead of protecting vulnerable communities and upholding the rule of law, the authorities have deepened longstanding anger and distrust among the communities through polarizing policies.”\nManipur’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state government, led by Chief Minister N. Biren Singh, an ethnic Meitei, has replicated his party’s divisive policies used nationally to promote Hindu majoritarianism. He has publicly claimed without any basis that the Kuki were providing sanctuary to illegal immigrants from Myanmar and engaged in drug trafficking, deforestation, and militancy.\nSince May 2023, over 200 people have been killed and hundreds injured. More than 60,000 people have been displaced and are living in cramped shelters. Several Kuki women have reported sexual violence and rape by Meitei mobs. Homes, businesses, villages, and places of worship, mostly targeting the Kuki community, have been burned down, attacked, and vandalized.\nThe latest violence reportedly began on September 1, when suspected Kuki militants attacked villages in West Imphal district using drones, killing two villagers and wounding several others. On September 6 in Bishnupur district, suspected Kuki militants carried out rocket attacks, killing an older man and injuring six others, including a 13-year-old girl. On September 7 in Jiribam district, six people were killed in gun violence between Meitei and Kuki groups. In Sekmai, a mob allegedly beat to death a Kuki man, while Meitei armed groups attacked a Central Police Reserve Force camp and nearby homes, killing a woman.\nThe current violence in Manipur state erupted on May 3, 2023, after tribal communities protested a Manipur High Court order granting the majority Meitei community certain benefits, including land ownership in protected areas and quotas in government jobs and college admissions. Such affirmative action is usually reserved for tribal groups to correct historical and structural inequity and discrimination. The protest, which included Kuki-Zo, among the larger tribal communities in Manipur, who live primarily in hill areas where the Meitei would be allowed to purchase land under the new ruling, turned violent with clashes between Meitei and Kuki-Zo. Manipur High Court revoked the contentious order in February 2024.\nTensions had already been rising for months with Meitei community members accusing the Kuki-Zo of being illegal migrants, cultivating poppies for the illegal drug trade, and benefiting from government quotas in jobs and education. The Kuki-Zo community accused the authorities of discrimination and of escalating the eviction of Kuki tribal villagers from forest areas.\nLocal activists have alleged that the state government has provided political patronage to violent vigilante groups that support the Meitei community. The Kuki-Zo communities have accused the groups of violent attacks, sexual abuse, and murder. The Manipur authorities have failed to investigate or take any action against groups implicated in violence.\nManipur has long faced secessionist insurgencies in which armed groups and government security forces have committed serious human rights abuses. Longstanding ethnic disputes, especially over land and natural resources, have often turned violent.\nThe Manipur state government should urgently adopt measures to protect the security of all communities, especially those particularly vulnerable, and de-escalate the violence. Local authorities need to ensure unhindered and adequate humanitarian aid to affected communities, permit access to the internet, and engage with civil society, including women from all sides, to address the longstanding issues between the communities. The state government should work with India’s central government to provide redress for victims of abuses, including for sexual violence, investigate and fairly prosecute those responsible, and act to demobilize and disarm abusive groups.\nLocal authorities in Manipur should uphold the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly in their response to the current situation. Security forces should abide by the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, which provide that security forces use the minimum necessary force at all times. In dispersing violent assemblies, firearms may only be used when other less harmful means are not practicable but to the minimum extent necessary. Law enforcement officers may only intentionally resort to lethal force when strictly unavoidable to protect life.\n“Manipur’s government has lost the trust of communities due to its partisan politics and failure to protect them from violence,” Ganguly said. “It can begin to build that trust by ensuring that victims and their families receive prompt redress, those responsible for abuses are held to account, and all communities are protected from further violence.”\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n$50\n$100\n$250\n$500\n$1000\nOther\nDONATE NOW\nRegion / Country\nAsia\nIndia\nMORE READING\nAugust 22, 2025 Statement\n8 Years On: Accountability Needed for Myanmar Atrocities Against Rohingya\nAugust 20, 2025 News Release\nSri Lanka: Police Target Families of ‘Disappeared’\nREPORTS\nJuly 14, 2025 Report\n“I’ll Never Feel Secure”\nUndocumented and Exploited: Myanmar Nationals in Thailand\nJuly 8, 2025 Report\nPunished For Getting Older\nSouth Korea’s Age-based Policies and Older Workers’ Rights\nMOST VIEWED\nNovember 25, 2019 Report\nA Dirty Investment\nDecember 7, 2011 Report\n\"How Come You Allow Little Girls to Get Married?\"\nAugust 20, 2025 Report\nDR Congo: M23 Mass Killings Near Virunga National Park\nAugust 14, 2020 Dispatches\nHorrific Video Shows Cameroon Killing\nSeptember 18, 2024 News Release\nIndonesia: Racism, Discrimination Against Indigenous Papuans\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\nDONATE NOW\nGet Updates On Rights Issues Worldwide\nSign Up\nConnect With Us\nBlueSky\nX\nFacebook\nYouTube\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nTikTok\nFooter menu\nContact UsCorrectionsPrivacy PolicyPermissionsSite MapChild SafeguardingText Version\n© 2025 Human Rights Watch\nHuman Rights Watch | 350 Fifth Avenue, 34th Floor | New York, NY 10118-3299 USA | t 1.212.290.4700\nHuman Rights Watch is a 501(C)(3) nonprofit registered in the US under EIN: 13-2875808\nHuman Rights Watch cookie preferences\nWe use cookies, tracking technologies, and third-party analytics tools to better understand who is using the website and improve your experience.

On average, 52 conflict incidents occur in Palestinian territories per day.\nBecause of Palestine’s — and specifically Gaza’s — level of violence compared to other conflicts and the lack of a ceasefire between combatants, it is very likely to continue being an intense conflict into 2025.\nWhile Palestine had the most dangerous and diffuse conflict in 2024, in Myanmar, an average of 170 distinct non-state armed groups were active each week, and the groups changed quite frequently.

For 2020, we recorded 104,371 conflict events; this year, for the same period, nearly 200,000.\nThe over 233,000 deaths are a conservative estimate of reported fatalities resulting from these events in the past year.\nThis is largely due to three very large conflicts beginning or restarting during that time — Ukraine, Gaza, and Myanmar — coupled with continued violence in many other countries with high rates of conflict, including Sudan, Mexico, Yemen, and Sahel countries, and very few conflicts ending. Civilian exposure to violence, conflict incidents, and the number of armed groups involved in violence are proliferating. \n2024 had a 25% increase in political violence events compared to 2023, similar to the average level of increase year-on-year since 2020.\nAll forms of conflict events have increased.\nBombings now represent over 90,000 events in 2024, are close to double the rate of battles, and triple the rate of direct violence against civilians. As states engage more with challengers domestically and internationally, warfare has become more sophisticated and widespread. Bombing and 'remote violence’ nearly doubled as of 2022, growing by over 25% per annum since 2022.\nMost protests are not included in the Index, but over 143,000 protests occurred in 2024, and major protest movements were linked to pro-Palestine agendas.  \nIn 2024, over 3 billion people across 70 countries went to the polls to vote in national elections. Many more cast their ballots to elect local representatives. Over a third of the countries where a national election was held this year experienced at least one act of electoral violence, affecting authoritarian and unstable states as well as established democracies.\nDid the countries with elections experience a notable increase in conflict rates?\nGenerally, yes: Countries with elections in 2024 had — on average— a 63% increase in national political violence compared to over 21% increases across countries without elections. Increases in violence occur when governments or political opposition groups are willing to use violence to remain in power or seize it when they believe that the vote has been rigged. Political interests then arm militias and mobilize their supporters well before election day. Post-election, countries often return to their pre-election disorder rate.\nYet, electoral violence is not overly effective: Election results in countries like India and Senegal — where incumbent governments lost their absolute majority and presidency despite widespread violence — suggest that violence does not stop democratic choice and change.\nBut the patterns of overall conflict confirm that living in a democracy is no insurance against conflict. Most conflict is not occurring in ‘poor’ or ‘isolated’ autocratic states but in ‘partially free’ countries.\nMost conflict is also now occurring in middle-income countries, and it is growing more strongly in middle- and high-income countries. In short, more development and democracy do not constrain violence. Conflict adapts to political circumstances, changing form and direction according to perpetrators’ agendas.\nMovement around the Index\nOver the course of 2024, Lebanon rose significantly in the Index, entering into the ‘extreme’ list, whereas it previously had hosted ‘high’ levels of conflict. Libya and Peru have also become worse, both because of increases in fatalities as a result of political violence. Overall levels of violence declined in Yemen despite remaining a site of very high conflict levels. Yemen has decreased consistently year-on-year — from more than 10,000 in 2020 to just over 2,000 in 2024 — but its violence is expanding into new areas and against new competitors in the Red Sea.\nHaiti has approximately double the number of events in 2024 compared to 2020 but reported fewer fatalities in the past year.\nDespite fears that the United States’ election year would result in a surge of violence, the US is no longer ‘turbulent.’ The US election was covered in great detail in our Crisis Monitor, and while pro-Palestinian protests were very popular across the US, militant and violent movements were massively overpredicted by the media, and significant violence did not occur.  \nViolence patterns are varied across the Index’s extremely conflicted countries.\nThe most violent places are experiencing quite different conflict types: From bombing campaigns across the Middle East, mob violence in India, a cartel civil war in Mexico, internal jihadi competition coupled with (formerly Wagner) mercenaries in the Sahel, Red Sea antagonisms, an inter-state stalemate in Ukraine, to Sudan’s violence upon civilians. \nCommunities and governments can be equally and deeply challenged by multiple gangs that extort, build illicit economies, kill civilians, and destroy public space and politics, as they are by an established insurgent group with a hierarchical military structure and national political agenda. Each form of conflict is detrimental and widespread, resulting in a larger share of the global population being exposed to continued political violence.\nThe conflicts that proliferated in 2024 starkly demonstrate the differences between being in power and being in control. In the Sahel, governments in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger are in power but hardly in control of the local areas: Rather, jihadi groups, external mercenaries, and local arrangements create a chessboard of control and competition. Governments in Myanmar, Mexico’s new president, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition are all running into the abyss of ‘control vs. power.’ The results are drastic increases in violence rates and more violent groups, while influence over how violence evolves and ends is elusive.\n2025: What to expect\nRecent levels of violence have been unprecedentedly high, with several ‘record-breaking’ months in the past year. What can we expect in 2025? At the beginning of 2025, conflict event rates are expected to grow by 15% due to more bombings and battles and result in approximately 20,000 reported fatalities per month.1\nThroughout the year, ACLED will assess whether conflict continues to increase or whether armed groups will revert to a high, but stable, average rate of violence. This will largely be determined by how specific conflict actors engage in violence across multiple places. The recent activity in Syria is a test case of whether the involvement of external parties (e.g., Iran, Russia, Hezbollah, Turkey) reduces the conflicts these actors are involved in elsewhere.\nThroughout 2025, levels of violence are expected to remain very high relative to the recent historical norm, and an annual increase of 20% is likely. However, the places, contenders, and forms of increased conflict in 2025 could be drastically different than the pattern in 2024. ACLED’s CAST will continue to predict conflict patterns throughout the year.\nDecember 2024 Conflict Index video\nLoad external content supplied by YouTube?\nYes (this time)\nManage privacy settings\nWatch the recorded launch of our ACLED Conflict Index & 2025 Watchlist.\nRead our 2025 Conflict Watchlist for a forecast of the upcoming year.\nConflict Index dashboard\nWeekly Conflict Index\nConflict Watchlist 2025\nPrevious releases\nThe Conflict Index was first launched in January 2023, and updated with an amended methodology in July 2023.

A political crisis resulted in the August toppling of the government in a military coup.\nArmed Islamist groups attacks on civilians, as well as soldiers and international forces, continued in northern Mali, intensified in the center, and spread into southern parts of the country. Ethnic self-defense groups, formed to protect villages from attacks, killed hundreds, leading to widespread displacement and hunger. The Malian security forces summarily executed scores of suspects for their perceived support of armed Islamist groups, and used excessive force when responding to political protests, resulting in at least 14 deaths.\nThe worsening security situation, perceived government corruption, and controversial parliamentary elections that were marred by violence and irregularities, provoked massive demonstrations in the capital, Bamako, and elsewhere.\nThe peace process envisioned to end the 2012-2013 crisis in the north made minimal progress, including on disarmament and the restoration of state authority. Over 40,000 civilians fled their homes as a result of violence in 2020. Attacks by armed groups on humanitarian agencies undermined their ability to deliver aid. Rampant banditry continued to undermine livelihoods. Attacks on children also continued. The United Nations reported that at least 185 children were killed due to communal violence, crossfire, or improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Armed groups and forces continued to recruit children as soldiers, and armed groups were responsible for at least 55 attacks on schools in 2019.\nLittle progress was made toward providing justice for victims of abuses, including several large-scale atrocities, and rule-of-law institutions remained weak.\nMali’s international partners, notably the UN, France, Germany, Canada, the European Union, the African Union (AU), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and the United States were more willing to denounce atrocities by the army than in past years but were inconsistent in their calls for accountability.\nPolitical Crisis, Violent Protests\nThe March 29 and April 19 parliamentary elections were marred by violence and irregularities. Controversial constitutional court rulings on 30 contested seats gave the ruling party a parliamentary majority and sparked massive protests during June and July. The protests, underscored by frustrations over government corruption and slow progress on addressing the security crisis, were led by a coalition of opposition political parties, religious leaders, and civil society organizations under the umbrella of The June 5 - Rally of Patriotic Forces Movement (Mouvement du 5 juin Rassemblement des Forces Patriotiques or M5-RFP).\nIn May, three opposition leaders including Clement Dembele, also an anti-corruption campaigner, were arrested for disrupting public order. Two of them were released within days, but Dembele was held for two weeks without due process. Charges against him were later dropped.  \nDuring demonstrations on July 10-12, protesters erected barricades; threw stones and used slingshots; occupied, burned, and looted parts of government buildings; and threatened a judge’s home. Security forces arrested, but released on July 13 at least five opposition leaders, ransacked the M5-RFP headquarters, and used teargas and live rounds to disperse protesters. Authorities blocked social media and messaging services in the country for several days during the unrest.\nOn August 18, military officers overthrew the government in a coup, and detained the president, prime minister, several cabinet members, and generals. The coup leaders, called the National Committee for the Salvation of the People and led by Col. Assimi Goïta, appointed Bah Ndaw, a former colonel and defense minister, as interim president on September 21. Ndaw promised a civilian government would be elected within 18 months.\nCommunal Violence\nDuring 2020, at least 400 villagers were killed in numerous incidents of communal violence, mostly in the Mopti region. The violence pitted ethnic Dogon self-defense groups against those of Peuhl, or Fulani, who sometimes had the support of armed Islamist groups. Most of those killed in 2020 were ethnic Dogon. The attacks targeted people in their villages, farms, or markets, and provoked widespread displacement and a hunger crisis.\nDuring attacks in March, Peuhl militiamen were implicated in the killing of 48 Dogon civilians in several villages in the Bankass administrative area, and at least 27 others on May 26 and 27, near Tillé village. In August, at least six Dogon were killed in Timiniri Administrative area near Bandiagara.  \nDogon militiamen were implicated in several attacks: in January on Siba village, killing 14; the March 14 massacre of 35 Peuhl villagers in Ogossagou village, site of the 2019 massacre of 150 civilians; the March 22 killing of at least 20 Peuhl in Baye commune, and the May 5 killing of 18 near Djenne. \nAbuses by Armed Islamist Groups\nArmed Islamist groups allied to Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara killed scores of mostly-Dogon civilians, as well as at least 5 peacekeepers and several hundred government security force members. In July, 32 Dogon were killed in attacks on Djimindo, Gouari and Fangadougou villages in Mopti region.\nArmed Islamist groups disrupted the parliamentary elections by ransacking polling stations, intimidating voters, and attacking soldiers escorting election materials. They killed numerous civilians with improvised explosive devices planted on roadways, including nine people in a public transport vehicle on March 29 in Timbuktu region, and seven people on June 7, in Mopti region. They also kidnapped scores of civilians, including aid workers, local government officials and political leaders, including an opposition presidential candidate, Soumaïla Cissé. \nArmed Islamists continued to threaten, and sometimes kill local leaders deemed government collaborators and beat those engaged in cultural practices they had forbidden. They also imposed their version of Sharia (Islamic law) via courts that did not adhere to fair trial standards.\nAbuses by State Security Forces\nMalian security forces were implicated in over 250 unlawful killings of suspects and civilians, and several enforced disappearances from December 2019 through August 2020. Most killings took place during counterterrorism operations in Mopti and Segou regions and targeted ethnic Peuhl. The UN also reported that soldiers from Burkina Faso were implicated in some 50 extrajudicial killings perpetrated during cross-border operations from May 26 to 28. \nOn December 19, 2019, Malian soldiers allegedly detained and executed at least 26 traders and then threw their bodies into a well in Ndoukala, Segou region. In June, soldiers were implicated in the killing of 14 people in Niangassadou village and 29 civilians in Binidama. In February, they allegedly executed 19 people in Ouro-Diam village.  \nMalian security forces also used lethal force in responding to protests in Bamako in July, resulting in at least 14 deaths. Over 300 people, including demonstrators, bystanders, and security force members were wounded.\nOn October 22, Malian forces were accused of killing two dozen Peuhl villagers in Libé, in the Bankass administrative area.\nNumerous men accused of terrorism-related offenses were detained by the national intelligence agency in unauthorized detention facilities and without respect for due process.\nAccountability for Abuses\nThere was little progress on delivering justice for war crimes and other atrocities committed since 2012. The government appeared to favor short-term reconciliation efforts envisioned to mitigate communal tension. \nThe judiciary remained plagued by neglect and mismanagement, with many abandoned posts in northern and central Mali due to insecurity. Hundreds of detainees were held in extended detention awaiting court trials. Over 1,600 prisoners were either pardoned or released to reduce the risk of the spread of Covid-19 in overcrowded prisons.\nThe Specialized Judicial Unit against Terrorism and Transnational Organized Crime (SJU), the investigations mandate of which was expanded in 2019 to include international human rights crimes, made progress on terrorism cases, and some progress on two 2019 atrocity investigations.\nIn late 2019, a court in the Mopti region tried and convicted some 45 people for several smaller incidents of communal violence, although magistrates had yet to question powerful militia leaders implicated in the worst atrocities. Security force members failed to respond to judicial summonses or help gendarmes arrest high-level suspects, hindering progress on these cases.\nMilitary authorities opened investigations into four alleged atrocities by security force members in 2019 and 2020, but these and previous investigations into the killing of over 50 suspects in 2018, have yet to result in trials or prosecutions.  \nTransitional Justice Mechanisms and Human Rights Commission\nThe International Commission of Inquiry, established under the 2015 peace accord to investigate serious violations between 2012 and January 2018, submitted its report to the UN secretary-general on June 16. At time of writing the report remained confidential.\nPublic hearings scheduled for 2020 by the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission, established in 2014 to investigate crimes and root causes of violence since 1960, were delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. \nThe National Commission for Human Rights investigated some abuses and issued numerous communiques but appeared reluctant to investigate abuses by the security forces. \nKey International Actors\nFrance and the United States led on military matters, the European Union on training and security sector reform, and the United Nations on rule of law and political stability. In the wake of the August coup, ECOWAS and the AU suspended Mali from their decision-making bodies; the US suspended military aid; and the EU suspended its military and police training programs.\nIn June, France launched the International Coalition for the Sahel, to coordinate between the G5 Sahel countries (Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad) and their international partners.\nOperation Barkhane, the 5,000-member French regional counterterrorism force, conducted numerous operations in Mali. Until the coup, the EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM) and EU Capacity Building Mission (EUCAP) continued to train and advise Mali’s security forces. \nIn June, the EU’s high representative expressed outrage at the killing of over 40 civilians with the likely involvement of Mali’s armed forces. He urged accountability for the crimes committed and stressed that the EU’s engagement is conditional to the respect of international human rights and humanitarian law. In September, the European Parliament echoed those concerns, urged the EU to support Mali’s democratic transition, and called for a comprehensive reform of the EUTM in order to ensure better selection, training and scrutiny of the armed forces and of their operations.\nThe UN Security Council renewed for one year the mandates of the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, MINUSMA, and the Mali Sanctions Committee Panel of Experts which, in August issued a report implicating high-level Malian officials in obstructing the 2015 peace process and failing to prevent the 2020 Ogossagou massacre. In June, the UN Human Rights Council renewed the mandate of the UN independent expert on Mali for another year.\nMINUSMA supported government atrocity investigations, justice sector reform, and increased patrols in areas vulnerable to attack. However, its ability to fulfill its civilian protection mandate was challenged due to lack of equipment, notably air assets. The human rights section significantly increased public reporting on abuses by all sides.\nIn July, the International Criminal Court (ICC) opened a trial against Al Hassan Ag Abdoul Aziz Ag Mohamed Ag Mahmoud, a former leader of the Islamist armed group Ansar Dine, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including rape and sexual slavery committed in 2012-2013. It is the ICC’s second trial in the Mali situation, and the court’s first trial of gender-based persecution.\nBrowse Countries\n                  Choose\n                          \nAfghanistan\n                   Algeria\n                   Angola\n                   Argentina\n                   Armenia\n                   Australia\n                   Azerbaijan\n                   Bahrain\n                   Bangladesh\n                   Belarus\n                   Bolivia\n                   Bosnia And Herzegovina\n                   Brazil\n                   Burkina Faso\n                   Burundi\n                   Cambodia\n                   Cameroon\n                   Canada\n                   Central African Republic\n                   Chile\n                   China\n                   Colombia\n                   Cuba\n                   Democratic Republic Of Congo\n                   Ecuador\n                   Egypt\n                   El Salvador\n                   Eritrea\n                   Eswatini\n                   Ethiopia\n                   European Union\n                   France\n                   Georgia\n                   Germany\n                   Greece\n                   Guatemala\n                   Guinea\n                   Haiti\n                   Honduras\n                   Hungary\n                   India\n                   Indonesia\n                   Iran\n                   Iraq\n                   Israel And Palestine\n                   Italy\n                   Japan\n                   Jordan\n                   Kazakhstan\n                   Kenya\n                   Kuwait\n                   Kyrgyzstan\n                   Lebanon\n                   Libya\n                   Malaysia\n                   Maldives\n                   Mali\n                   Mauritania\n                   Mexico\n                   Morocco/Western Sahara\n                   Mozambique\n                   Myanmar\n                   Nepal\n                   Nicaragua\n                   Nigeria\n                   North Korea\n                   Oman\n                   Pakistan\n                   Papua New Guinea\n                   Peru\n                   Philippines\n                   Poland\n                   Qatar\n                   Russia\n                   Rwanda\n                   Saudi Arabia\n                   Serbia/Kosovo\n                   Singapore\n                   Somalia\n                   South Africa\n                   South Korea\n                   South Sudan\n                   Spain\n                   Sri Lanka\n                   Sudan\n                   Syria\n                   Tajikistan\n                   Tanzania\n                   Thailand\n                   Tunisia\n                   Turkey\n                   Turkmenistan\n                   Uganda\n                   Ukraine\n                   United Arab Emirates\n                   United Kingdom\n                   United States\n                   Uzbekistan\n                   Venezuela\n                   Vietnam\n                   Yemen\n                   Zimbabwe\n               Protecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\nDONATE NOW\nGet Updates On Rights Issues Worldwide\nSign Up\nConnect With Us\nBlueSky\nX\nFacebook\nYouTube\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nTikTok\nFooter menu\nContact UsCorrectionsPrivacy PolicyPermissionsSite MapChild SafeguardingText Version\n© 2025 Human Rights Watch\nHuman Rights Watch | 350 Fifth Avenue, 34th Floor | New York, NY 10118-3299 USA | t 1.212.290.4700\nHuman Rights Watch is a 501(C)(3) nonprofit registered in the US under EIN: 13-2875808\nHuman Rights Watch cookie preferences\nWe use cookies, tracking technologies, and third-party analytics tools to better understand who is using the website and improve your experience.

My partner did not like me to go out, not even to church. If I did, I would get beaten up”, explained a survivor of gender-based violence—who spoke anonymously with us to protect her safety—during a visit of UN authorities to a safe house. \nHonduras has the highest femicide rate in the Latin American region, with 6.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In 2020, 278 women were murdered in the country and, as of November 2021, more than 240 women have lost their lives violently.  \nDuring the pandemic, violence cases against women increased significantly; the number of emergency calls rose to 282 per day. \nLaws to support survivors \nCaption: Ana Cruz of Asociación Calidad de Vida, an anti-violence organization.\nPhoto: © UN Honduras\n“Our message is that we shouldn’t leave women’s and feminist institutions that fight to eradicate violence against women alone [on their mission]”, said Ana Cruz of Asociación Calidad de Vida, an anti-violence organization. “It is urgent to pass the law on safe houses where women who manage to get away from violent situations are taken care of”. \nThe law on safe houses, which has been stalled in the National Congress since 2018, aims to recognize and fund safe houses to provide care for survivors of multiple forms of violence, ensuring their wellbeing and that of their families. Civil society continues to advocate for this law to be passed and the United Nations has joined in these efforts. \n\"My respect to the brave women survivors of domestic violence! My appreciation and congratulations to Ana Cruz and the fantastic work of safe houses! The law on safe houses needs to be passed!\", expressed the UN Resident Coordinator in Honduras, Alice Shackelford, on Twitter. \nCaption: UN Resident Coordinator in Honduras, Alice Shackelford meets with survivors at a local safe house.\nPhoto: © UN Honduras\nMobilizing the public for positive change \nMassay Crisantho is one of the 21 most influential people named ambassadors to help advocate on ending violence against women and girls by the United Nations in Honduras.  \n“Through this initiative I can be a spokesperson for women who experience this type of violence and I can use my platforms to inform and raise awareness about the issue in a male-dominated society where we normalize this type of situation”, said Massay Crisantho, who is and activist and advocate for the human rights and the culture of the Garifuna ethnic community. \nCaption: Activist Massay Crisantho uses her influence and far-reaching platforms to advocate for the rights of women and girls in the country.\nPhoto: © UN Honduras/Allan Chan\nIt is not only women who must strengthen a social movement that contributes to breaking gender stereotype paradigms and cycles of sexism that lead to gender-based violence. \n\"I think it is important that young people, and particularly men, raise awareness about this type of violence,\" added Daniel Vijil, from the youth institution El Milenio. \"Indeed, women are the affected ones, but as men, we have a greater opportunity to influence other men and make them reflect on how we impact our sisters, friends and colleagues with our behaviour”. \nEducation as a force for change \nThe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), through the Spotlight Initiative and in partnership with civil society organizations, launched the \"The Other Pandemic\" campaign in order to activate a social movement to address and prevent gender-based violence. \n\"I am a survivor of domestic violence and I am lucky to be alive,\" said Rosa Maria Perez at the launch of the campaign. \"Two years ago, I came asking for help at a time when I couldn't take it anymore, to the extent that I intended to attempt against my life, with no hope for anything. Shall I live on, or shall I die? My decision was to die.\" The campaign includes a docuseries in which the testimonies of women survivors, like Rosa María, are central to raise awareness among the Honduran population on zero tolerance of all forms of violence against women and girls. The campaign and its different audiovisual assets have been broadcasted by over 15 media outlets nationwide and free of charge, including the country's most-watched TV network. \nThe role of data to help end violence against women \nCaption: On 25th November, women and men rallied together to raise awareness of the increasing femicide rates and growing violence against women and girls at a UN-supported event.\nPhoto: © UN Honduras\nMedia activism must be part of the change of paradigm; data plays a key role in understanding the impact on the Honduran population of how media report on violence against women. A large number of media have distorted the population’s perception on violence against women by informing about it in a way that makes it seems as if these are isolated cases, when the reality is that this is an endemic issue in the Honduran society.  \nA study conducted by the Spotlight Initiative and civil society partners—including the University Institute for Democracy, Peace and Security (IUDPAS) of the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH) and the communications company Sien—provided data on how media messages about violence against women are framed in the news.  \nAmong the findings is that nine out of 10 news stories promote the dissemination of morbid details, include inadequate justifications and stereotypical reporting, which adds on to the misrepresentation of reality, which affects how this type of news is understood and interpreted by the public. As a result of this study, UN Women will be organizing trainings for media outlets on objective and respectful journalism in these types of subjects. \nDuring the presentation of these findings, Alice Shackelford called for \"changing the narrative and expressing our intolerance towards this type of violence\".\n\"The issue of gender-based violence is a central human rights issue. The women who have lost their lives violently this year are women who can no longer contribute to the economy and development of Honduras\", she regretted. \nIn Honduras, the United Nations is committed to continue working together with a wide range of sectors of the country in achieving a more just and equitable society, where it isn’t dangerous to be a woman. \nStory written by Maria Elena Cálix, Communications and Advocacy Officer at the Office of the Resident Coordinator in Honduras.

Little progress was made in reaching a negotiated settlement, advancing justice for abuses, or addressing development challenges.\nThe withdrawal in May of Malian civil servants and soldiers from key towns in the north, following a brief resumption of hostilities, resulted in a rise in ethnic tension, left large swaths of territory devoid of state authority, and led to a significant rise in banditry by unidentified gunmen. Meanwhile, there was little progress on security sector reform or the disarmament of fighters in the north.\nMalian authorities made little effort to investigate and hold accountable those implicated in serious abuses committed during the 2012-2013 armed conflict. However, there was a decrease in abuses by state security forces and progress in the investigation into the 2012 torture and killing of 21 elite soldiers. Rule of law institutions countrywide were weak, in part due to unprofessional practices and inadequate budgetary allocations for the criminal justice system. Corruption, endemic at all levels of government, further impeded Malians’ access to basic health care and education.\nConcerns about the deteriorating security situation and re-entrenchment of Al-Qaeda-linked groups in the north sustained diplomatic interest in Mali. The French government played a key role in military matters, the European Union on training and security sector reform, and the United Nations, through the Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), on rule of law and political stability. These actors were largely reluctant to publicly call for investigations into past and ongoing crimes. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank pressed the government over bad economic governance.\nAbuses by Armed Groups in the North  \nSince late September 2013, opposition armed groups carried out several dozen ambushes and suicide bombings, and deployed improvised explosive devices and landmines. Most attacks targeted Malian and French troops, though others targeted civilians and peacekeepers in violation of the laws of war. Landmines on key roads and rocket attacks in major towns generated a climate of fear for civilians, and killed and wounded several. Over 30 UN peacekeepers died in attacks.\nIn February, the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO) kidnapped five aid workers from the International Committee of the Red Cross; they were freed in April during a French military operation. In May, two aid workers with the Norwegian Refugee Council were killed when their vehicle struck an improvised explosive device near Timbuktu.\nA visit by the prime minister to the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) stronghold of Kidal in May led to brief resumption of hostilities. During the clashes, eight civilians, including six civil servants, were allegedly summarily executed by the armed groups occupying Kidal.\nSecurity in the north was further undermined by persistent inter-communal clashes, particularly involving people from the Peuhl, Tuareg, and Arab ethnic groups, which left dozens dead. Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) continued at time of writing to hold four hostages; one from France, one from the Netherlands, one from Sweden, and a dual British and South African national. During 2014, one French and one Algerian hostage reportedly died in captivity, while two Algerians captured in Gao in 2012 were released.\nAbuses by State Security Forces\nIn 2014, the number of violations committed by the Malian army decreased, but soldiers were implicated in several cases of arbitrary detention, one instance of excessive use of force in responding to a demonstration in Kidal, and several summary executions, largely targeting Tuareg men. The military hierarchy made some effort to investigate and hold to account soldiers implicated in several of these incidents. Members of the security forces were also implicated in acts of extortion, bribe taking, and to a lesser extent rape.\nAccountability for Abuses during the 2012-2013 Armed Conflict\nThe government made little progress in holding to account those from all warring factions responsible for laws of war violations committed during the 2012-2013 armed conflict. The government’s provisional release in 2014 of over 40 men associated with the conflict, including several commanders credibly implicated in abuses, raised concern of a de facto amnesty for these crimes. The government characterized the releases, which began in late 2013, as “confidence building measures” in advance of negotiations. They were carried out without regard as to whether the men might have been responsible for serious crimes in violation of international law.\nSupreme Court orders passed in 2013 permitted a Bamako court to hear criminal cases from the three northern provinces, and during 2014, dozens of families filed complaints to judicial authorities. With few exceptions, these authorities failed to investigate any of these cases or others that human rights groups and journalists brought to their attention.\nThere was, however, meaningful progress in the investigation into the torture and enforced disappearance of 21 elite “Red Berets” in 2012. In late 2013 and early 2014, some 25 soldiers, including former coup leader Gen. Amadou Haya Sanogo, were charged in connection with the crimes.\nIn July 2012, Mali, a state party to the International Criminal Court (ICC), referred “the situation in Mali since January 2012” to the ICC prosecutor for investigation. On January 16, 2013, the ICC prosecutor formally opened an investigation into grave crimes allegedly committed in the northern three regions of Mali, and during 2014, ICC investigators conducted several missions to the country.\nTruth and Reconciliation Mechanism\nAfter assuming office in September 2013, President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita dissolved a pre-existing truth commission and, by two executive orders, established the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission; on March 20, the National Assembly ratified the orders. The commission has a three-year mandate, will cover the period from 1960 to 2013, and will consist of 15 members and 7 working groups. It will function under the Ministry of National Reconciliation and Development of the North.\nBy late 2014, the commissioners had yet to be appointed and the body’s credibility was limited because of the failure to consult sufficiently with a wide variety of stakeholders on its members, mandate powers, and degree of independence.\nJudiciary\nDuring 2014, there was progress in re-establishing the judiciary in Timbuktu and Gao regions, evident in the rehabilitation of local courthouses and jails and redeployment of prosecutors, judges, and judicial police who had fled during the armed conflict. However, their ability to conduct investigations outside major towns was limited by the precarious security situation.\nNeglect and mismanagement within the Malian judiciary countrywide led to striking deficiencies, including insufficient staffing and logistical constraints. These shortfalls hindered efforts to address impunity for perpetrators of all crimes and contributed to violations of the right to due process.\nBecause of the courts’ inability to adequately process cases, hundreds of detainees are held in extended pretrial detention in overcrowded jails and detention centers. Judges in Bamako mandated to investigate several hundred suspects detained during the offensive to retake the north made some progress, resulting in the release of scores of men who appeared to have been arbitrarily detained, largely as a result of their ethnicity.\nRecruitment of Children and Child Labor\nArmed groups in the north continued to recruit and use child soldiers, some as young as 12. During 2014, some 20 schools in the north were at various times occupied by members of the armed groups, pro-government militias, the Malian army and, in one case, MINUSMA. Several children suspected of supporting the armed groups were detained in both the Bamako Central Prison and a gendarme camp in Bamako, in contravention of a 2013 protocol signed by the government stipulating that children were to be placed in a care center managed by the UN Children’s Rights Emergency and Relief Organization.\nChild labor in agriculture, domestic service, mining, and other sectors was common, and often included dangerous work that Malian law prohibits for anyone under the age of 18. Child laborers in artisanal gold mining were exposed to health risks from accidents and exposure to toxic mercury.\nKey International Actors\nIn June, the UN Security Council renewed the mandate of MINUSMA, the peacekeeping mission with a troop ceiling of 11,200 military personnel, some 70 percent of whom are currently deployed. The UN independent expert on the situation of human rights in Mali, Suliman Baldo, conducted two missions and pressed for progress in the fight against impunity. In March, the UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution that welcomed progress, expressed concerns on continued violations and abuses, and renewed the mandate of the independent expert. The UN Peacebuilding fund supported demobilization, reconciliation, and justice projects.\nThe African Union (AU) brokered a ceasefire in May that paved the way for Algerian and AU-led negotiations between the Malian government and several armed groups; the talks took place in the Algerian capital, Algiers.\nThe 1,700 strong French military operation known as Operation Serval was in August transformed into a 3,000-strong regional operation—known as Operation Barkhane—to address the threat of instability in Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad.\nThe European Union Training Mission in Mali trained eight battalions of Malian soldiers, while the EU Capacity Building Mission, EUCAP Sahel Mali, was established to train the police, gendarmerie, and National Guard.\nThe EU and Dutch took the lead on justice sector reform and support. The UN Development Programme supported the rehabilitation of courthouses, while the United States provided forensic support to the Ministry of Justice.\nIn May and June 2014, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank collectively delayed almost US$70 million in payments to the Malian government following questions surrounding the extra-budgetary purchase of a presidential plane and inflated military contracts. An audit revealed overbilling of over $56 million in the military budget. \nBrowse Countries\n                  Choose\n                          \nWorld Report 2015: Afghanistan\n

Ethnic Uzbeks and other minorities remain especially vulnerable. Courtroom attacks on lawyers and defendants, particularly in cases related to the June 2010 events, occur with impunity.\nHuman rights defender Azimjon Askarov remains wrongfully imprisoned. In 2013, authorities proposed legislative initiatives to tighten restrictions on nongovernmental groups.Violence and discrimination against women and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons remain concerns. Some religious groups have faced harassment by the authorities. \"Insult\" and \"insult of a public official\" remain criminal offenses.\nGovernment officials and civil society representatives formed a national center for the prevention of torture in 2013. In practice, ill-treatment and torture remain pervasive in places of detention, and impunity for torture is the norm.\nAccess to Justice\nThree years on, justice for crimes committed during the ethnic violence in southernKyrgyzstan in June 2010 remains elusive. The flawed justice process has produced long prison sentences for mostly ethnic Uzbeks after convictions marred by torture-tainted confessions and other due process violations. Authorities have not reviewed convictions where defendants alleged torture or other glaring violations of fair trial standards. At least nine ethnic Uzbeks continue to languish in pretrial detention, some for a third year. New convictions in August 2013 of three ethnic Uzbeks in Osh, and pending extradition orders of at least six others in Russia again point to judicial bias against ethnic Uzbeks.\nThe authorities failed to tackle the acute problem of courtroom violence by audiences in trials across Kyrgyzstan, including at the trial of three opposition members of parliament in June, perpetuating an environment that undermines defendants’ fair trial rights. Lawyers were harassed or beaten in court in 2013, including for defending ethnic Uzbek clients in June 2010 cases. Mahamad Bizurukov, an ethnic Uzbek defendant, and his lawyers have been subjected to repeated threats, harassment, and physical attacks for two years, most recently in September 2013, with no accountability for perpetrators.\nTorture\nDespite the adoption of a national torture prevention mechanism in 2012, and the organization of a related National Center for the Prevention of Torture in 2013, authorities often refuse to investigate allegations of torture and perpetrators go unpunished. On rare occasions when charges are filed against police, investigations, and court proceedings are unduly protracted.\nA telling example is the criminal case against four police officers following the August 2011 death of an ethnic Uzbek detained on charges related to the June 2010 ethnic violence. Usmonjon Kholmirzaev died several days after his release without charge, apparently from injuries he sustained from beatings in custody. The prosecution has been subjected to repeated delays over the last two years and no one has yet been held accountable for his death.\nIn July 2013, Nurkamil Ismailov was found dead in a temporary detention facility in southern Kyrgyzstan after police detained him for disorderly conduct. Authorities alleged he committed suicide by hanging himself with his t-shirt. The Jalalabad-based human rights group Spravedlivost intervened after which authorities opened a criminal investigation on charges of negligence. In September, Ismailov’s relative and the police settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, with no admission of liability.\nFreedom of Expression\nIn April 2013, internet providers in Kyrgyzstan lifted a 14-month ban on the independent online Central Asian news agency Ferghana.ru, after Kyrgyzstan’s state media agency wrote a letter stating its previous notice urging providers to block Ferghana.ru was only a recommendation, not compulsory.\nIn June, OSCE representative on freedom of the media, Dunja Mijatovic, noted Kyrgyzstan’s “progress in promoting media freedom and freedom of expression.” Mijatovic urged authorities to bring to justice individuals responsible for the 2007 death of journalist Alisher Saipov, whose killers have not been identified.\nAlthough Osh-based Yntymak Radio began broadcasting in Russian, Kyrgyz, and Uzbek languages in March 2012, concerns persist regarding restrictions on Uzbek-language media in southern Kyrgyzstan. In March 2013, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) noted “that the use of minority languages in media has decreased in particular in the Osh region.” In July, an Osh court banned the Uzbek-language news site Harakat.net for allegedly inciting racial hatred.\nSexual Orientation and Gender-Based Violence\nThe authorities’ approach to long-standing problems of gender-based violence, including domestic violence and bride abduction, remains ineffective. In December 2012, the Kyrgyz legislature adopted an amendment to increase the maximum jail sentence for bride-kidnapping from three to seven years (10 years if the girl is younger than 17).\nIn 2013, Labrys and Kyrgyz Indigo, LGBT rights groups, documented at least four new cases of police extortion and harassment of at least seven LGBT people. Gay and bisexual men are at particular risk of extortion, beating, and sexual violence. They rarely report abuses to the authorities due to fear of disclosure and retaliation, and abuses largely go unpunished. In March, unidentified assailants attacked two Labrys staff in Bishkek at a disco; one suffered a concussion. Police initially refused to register their complaint, which alleged the attack was a hate crime, and had yet to investigate at time of writing.\nCivil Society\nOn November 17, 2012, agents of the State Committee on National Security (GKNB) temporarily detained an international staff member of the International Crisis Group (ICG), an international NGO working on peace and security issues, and without explanation, illegally searched and interrogated him, and confiscated his computer. He was later expelled from Kyrgyzstan. The GKNB later summoned five people for questioning apparently in connection with the ICG’s work.\nIn 2013, the government sought to tighten control over civil society, proposing three legislative amendments that would impose burdensome reporting obligations and restrictions on civil society groups. Activists successfully lobbied to remove discriminatory provisions from two proposals. The third would require groups accepting foreign funding to register and identify themselves publicly as “foreign agents.” At time of writing, it had not been reviewed by parliament.\nIn May, human rights lawyerUlugbek Azimov, an ethnic Uzbek, and two members of his family were viciously assaulted after a traffic incident in Bishkek. Police found and prosecuted one of the attackers, but others remain at large. Azimov’s colleagues believe the attack may have been ethnically-motivated.\nAzimjon Askarov, a human rights defender who worked to document police treatment of detainees, continues to serve a life sentence, despite a prosecution marred by serious violations of fair trial standards. Askarov was found guilty of “organizing mass disorders,” “inciting ethnic hatred,” and taking part in killing a police officer on June 13, 2010. Despite repeated complaints filed by Askarov’s lawyer, including in 2013, prosecutorial authorities have refused to investigate Askarov’s credible allegations of torture in custody. Askarov’s November 2012 complaint to the United Nations Human Rights Committee is under review.\nRefugees\nIn recent years, Kyrgyzstan’s efforts to host refugees and asylum seekers have been undermined by the government’s failure to implement fully its obligations to protect the rights of asylum seekers and refugees from Uzbekistan. After a long court battle, in May 2013, a Bishkek court overturned the Prosecutor General’s Office’s extradition order for Khabibullo Sulaimanov, a former Imam from Uzbekistan, after he was granted refugee status by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In February, Shukhrat Musin, a refugee from Uzbekistan who fled religious persecution, was reported missing in Bishkek. In October, he was located in a pretrial detention center in Andijan, Uzbekistan.\nFreedom of Religion\nIn December 2012, President Atambaev signed amendments to Kyrgyzstan's religion laws authorizing greater control over religious literature deemed \"extremist.” Forum18, an international religious freedom watchdog, reported harassment of smaller religious communities in 2013, including of Jehovah’s Witnesses and Ahmadi Muslims.\nKey International Actors\nKyrgyzstan’s partners raised human rights concerns throughout the year, but did not consistently seize opportunities to urge concrete improvements.\nStatements issued by European Union leaders on the occasion of Kyrgyz president’s September 2013 visit to Brussels noted challenges in upholding the rule of law and the rights of minorities, but stopped short of urging any concrete improvements. The ministerial-level cooperation council meeting with Kyrgyzstan, held in November, urged “further steps to address human rights concerns,” stressing “inter-ethnic reconciliation” and the “significant role” played by civil society.\nIn December 2012, German Chancellor Angela Merkel specifically noted concern about Azimjon Askarov’s imprisonment and the rights of ethnic minorities. During a Kyrgyzstan visit in May, UN Assistant Secretary General for Human Rights Ivan Simonovic raised Askarov’s case, violence against women, and the need to address discrimination on grounds of ethnicity, religion, and gender.\nFollowing her mission to Kyrgyzstan in April 2013, UN special rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution, and child pornography, Najat Maalla M’jid, highlighted the country’s insufficient protection of children from violence, exploitation, and abuse, and urged law enforcement agencies to do more to investigate, prosecute, and punish perpetrators.\nIn its March 2013 concluding observations, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) voiced serious concerns about the treatment of ethnic minorities in Kyrgyzstan, including due process violations in court proceedings following the June 2010 violence, allegations of torture, restrictions on Uzbek-language media, and violence against ethnic minority women. The committee also noted a few positive developments, including the adoption of a policy on inter-ethnic relations.\nDuring its review of Kyrgyzstan in November, the UN Committee Against Torture noted that “[fundamental safeguards] were not upheld in practice” and expressed “serious concern about prison conditions.”\nBrowse Countries\n                  Choose\n                          \nWorld

Reeves\n“The nation’s consciousness has been raised by the repeated acts of police brutality against blacks. But the problem of public space violence—seen in the extraordinary distress, trauma and pain many poor inner-city families experience following the killing of a family member or close relative—also deserves our special attention.”\nSo argued William Julius Wilson, world-renowned scholar and newly appointed Brookings Nonresident Senior Fellow, on this blog yesterday. That special attention could usefully start with some of the most important facts. Gun deaths vary dramatically by gender and race:\n\nYoung adult gun deaths by race and gender\nThe differences among young adults—those aged between 20 and 29—are even starker, according to CDC data for 2011 through 2013:\n\nIn 2013, firearm deaths accounted for over 11 percent of all years of potential life lost among the black population, but less than 6 percent of all years of potential life lost among the white population.\nWhite suicides, black homicides\nGun deaths also vary dramatically by type. The vast majority (77 percent) of white gun deaths are suicides; less than one in five (19 percent) is a homicide. These figures are nearly opposite in the black population, where only 14 percent of gun deaths are suicides but 82 percent are homicides:\n\nThe firearm homicide rate among black men aged 20-29 is about 89 per 100,000.To put that fact in some international perspective, in Honduras—the country with the highest recorded homicide rate—there were 90.4 intentional murders per 100,000 people in 2012. That includes all means, not just firearm homicides.\n‘Distress, trauma, and pain’: social costs\nGun violence can have a series of serious snowball effects in education, health, incarceration, family instability, and social capital. To take one example, anxiety levels rise and cognitive functioning worsens among school children following a violent crime within half a mile of their home, according to a study by Dana Charles McCoy, C. Cybele Raver and Patrick Sharkey. Individuals who witness violence are also at increased risk for a variety of mental health issues, which can manifest as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, poor academic performance, substance abuse, risky sexual behavior, delinquency, and violent behavior, notes David Hemenway. And as Wilson suggests, these costs weigh largely on the shoulders of black Americans.\nGun violence is part of a vicious cycle of race and inequality in the U.S., reflecting existing social inequalities, and also making it even more challenging for young black people, especially young black men, to escape poverty and violence.\nRELATED CONTENT\nCharts of the Week: Gun violence\nCharts of the Week: Gun violence\nThe other side of Black Lives Matter\nThe other side of Black Lives Matter\nMedicaid funding to address gun violence appears promising for some states\nMedicaid funding to address gun violence appears promising for some states\nRELATED BOOKS\nEvaluating Gun Policy\nEvaluating Gun Policy\nProtecting the Dispossessed\nProtecting the Dispossessed\nSetting Domestic Priorities\nSetting Domestic Priorities\nAUTHORS\nRichard V.

Insurgents and security forces have killed thousands of civilians and created a catastrophic humanitarian crisis that is internally displacing hundreds of thousands of Malians.\n The roots of the current conflict are linked to the 2011 Libyan Civil War. Ethnic Tuareg, members of a minority group in northern Mali that have historically faced intense Malian government persecution, joined the fighting to support Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. When NATO-backed rebels overthrew Gaddafi in 2011, mercenary Tuareg fighters returned to northern Mali and brought with them a flood of heavy weapons.\n After the fall of Gaddafi, a small number of Tuaregs then revived a long-standing separatist movement. The Tuareg separatists, under the banner of the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), joined in a tacit alliance with armed Islamist groups in northern Mali. Alongside Ansar Dine, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), and the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO), the MNLA led an insurgency against the Malian government in January 2012.\n In April 2012, military officials orchestrated a coup d’état to oust Mali’s democratically elected leader, Amadou Toumani Touré in April 2012. The MNLA insurgent coalition seized control of northern Mali aiming to establish a state based on their unique ethnic identity. However, the secular, nationalist goals of the Tuareg MNLA clashed with the jihadists vision to implement a strict interpretation of sharia across the region. By June, the Islamists fully co-opted the movement and pushed out the Tuareg MNLA.\n In a controversial French-led military intervention in 2013, government forces regained control over northern Mali. The intervention expelled the Islamists from their strongholds in the north and in doing so, unintentionally scattered the fundamentalists across central and southern Mali, where jihadist violence is currently gripping the region.\n Since 2015, jihadist attacks in central Mali have spiked dramatically. Fundamentalists have recruited militants primarily from the Peules/Fulani ethnic group, stoking a regional conflict that has directly instigated ethnic violence. In response to the increasing Islamist attacks, various Malian ethnic groups have formed self-defense militias, which has created a tit-for-tat cycle of attacks against neighboring ethnic groups. Dan Na Ambassagou, a Dogon ethnic self-defense militia, has committed executions of hundreds of Peules/Fulani civilians.\n Despite the presence of a UN peacekeeping mission since 2013 and a French-led counterterrorism force in operation since 2014, the security situation in central Mali has continued to deteriorate. In 2019, fundamentalists killed 4,000 people across Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. In the first six months of 2020 alone, the UN reported 589 civilians killed by various armed groups in central Mali.\n Genocide Watch recognizes the alarming situation in Mali as Stage 9: Extermination.\n To prevent further bloodshed in Mali, Genocide Watch recommends: \nThe United Nations peacekeeping force in Mali (MINUSMA), the French-led counterterrorism force (Operation Barkane), and the regional G5 Sahel Joint Forces review their tactical plan to ensure that they are not providing proxy support to security forces and allied militia members who are themselves committing mass atrocities across Mali.  \nThe Malian government provide increased protection to villages in central Mali to reduce the need for self-defense militias and break the cycle of vigilantism.  \nThe Malian government work with local spiritual and community leaders to foster dialogue between ethnic groups and deescalate ethnic tensions through education and outreach aimed at alleviating the root causes of the violence.  \nNGOs and other international actors increase humanitarian assistance to Mali and provide economic opportunities to individuals tempted to otherwise join armed Islamist groups. \n Download Alert\n       Tags:\nSahel\nMali\nExtermination\nAl-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb\nMINUSMA\n Recent Posts\nSee All\nIsraeli bombardment kills six in Yemen’s Sanaa after Houthi attacks\n UN Envoy Warns of Renewed Violence in Syria\n Follow Genocide Watch for more updates:"

Over 400 people were killed and nearly two thousand homes were destroyed. But the authorities have failed to ensure accountability for crimes committed during the violence, or justice for the people arbitrarily arrested and convicted in trials marred by widespread allegations of ill-treatment and torture in the aftermath.\n\n“Justice has been elusive for so many people who suffered horrific crimes during and after the violent events of June 2010,” said Mihra Rittmann, senior Central Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “While southern Kyrgyzstan has long ceased to be a site of open ethnic conflict, until there is accountability for past abuses, there will always be legitimate concerns about the prospect of long-term stability in the region.”\n\nWhile horrific crimes were committed against both ethnic Uzbeks and Kyrgyz in June 2010, most of those who were killed or lost their homes in the mayhem were from the ethnic Uzbek community.\n\nKyrgyz authorities have held some people responsible for crimes committed during the June 2010 violence. According to government data published in 2017, “Courts have considered 286 cases involving 488 persons” in relation to the June 2010 violence. However, most criminal investigations into crimes committed during the violence, nearly 4,000 of over 5,000 cases, according to government data published in 2017, have been suspended because the accused could not be identified or could not be found.\n\nThe Kyrgyz government has not acknowledged that ethnic Uzbeks disproportionately were the victims of attacks or that attacks on ethnic Uzbek neighborhoods were systematic. Human Rights Watch noted in 2012 that the vast majority of criminal cases in which the victims were ethnic Uzbeks had yet to be investigated.\n\nThe government said in 2011 that both sides were “equally armed, committed violence against each other and suffered casualties.” This stance whitewashes the killings, suffering, and unfair trials that disproportionally affected ethnic Uzbeks, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nAn ethnic Uzbek lawyer from southern Kyrgyzstan, who asked not to be named out of fear of reprisals, described what the lack of accountability has meant for him and his community.\n\n“Psychologically, it stays with you,” he told Human Rights Watch. “An act of reconciliation did not take place. Many friends, people who suffered, whose relatives were jailed – no one ever answered for [the abuses]. It makes you feel psychologically vulnerable. You still feel [vulnerable] today.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch also documented that the profoundly flawed criminal investigations and trials, mainly affecting the ethnic Uzbek minority, were marred by widespread arbitrary arrests and ill-treatment, including torture. Prosecutorial authorities refused to investigate torture allegations, and frequent physical attacks against defendants and their lawyers marred courtroom proceedings, Human Rights Watch found.\n\nAn independent international commission that carried out an investigation into the conflict at the request of the Kyrgyz government arrived at similar conclusions regarding abuses committed during and after the June 2010 violence.\n\nThe Kyrgyz government asserted in its 2016 report to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), that “All participants in criminal proceedings in Kyrgyzstan enjoy equal rights and have equal opportunities…” and that “there have been no reported instances of violations by judicial bodies of the right to a fair trial in criminal cases connected with the June 2010 events.”\n\nHowever, the human rights organization, Bir Duino, cited official data to CERD showing that over 70 percent of the people criminally prosecuted in connection with the June 2010 violence were ethnic Uzbek. The group further noted that out of 105 people prosecuted for killings committed during the violence, 97 are ethnic Uzbek and seven are Kyrgyz.\n\nThe government stated that the authorities opened five criminal investigations into allegations of torture. Human Rights Watch has not been able to determine whether any officers were ever formally charged or prosecuted as a result of these investigations.\n\nTen years on, the ethnic Uzbek community in southern Kyrgyzstan retains an underlying sense of fear and insecurity, especially with respect to law enforcement and the judiciary. “As far as the courts are concerned, and in terms of political representation, nothing has changed,” an ethnic Uzbek human rights defender in southern Kyrgyzstan told Human Rights Watch. As a result, “it’s very hard for me to do my work.” He asked not to be named for fear of repercussions.\n\nThe Kyrgyz government should commit to ensuring accountability for its citizens, regardless of their ethnicity, and take meaningful steps toward addressing outstanding grievances of the ethnic Uzbek community in southern Kyrgyzstan, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nKyrgyz authorities should ensure thorough and impartial investigations into the use of torture during investigations and set up a review process for all criminal cases related to the clashes in which there were credible allegations of torture and other human rights violations against the defendants that may make the verdicts unsound. The government should renew any efforts to ensure proportionate ethnic representation in government, law enforcement, and the judiciary.\n\nThe authorities should also carry out the 2016 United Nations (UN) Human Rights Committee decision that calls for the release from prison of the human rights defender Azimjon Askarov, as he was detained and prosecuted in violation of his rights, including being tortured.\n\nFollowing his December 2019 visit to Kyrgyzstan, the UN special rapporteur on minority issues, Fernand de Varennes, said that ethnic relations in Kyrgyzstan “remain fragile” and that factors including “underrepresentation of minorities” and “unfair treatment by law enforcement,” could “bring the level of inter-ethnic tension to a breaking point.”\n\n“Peace and stability in southern Kyrgyzstan today are undermined by a legacy of injustice,” Rittmann said. “If the Kyrgyz authorities want to definitively turn the page, they need to do the hard work of confronting past injustices, and provide accountability and closure for all the victims of the June 2010 violence and its aftermath.”\n\nFor more details, please see below.\n\nThe 2010 Violence\n\nBoth ethnic Uzbeks and Kyrgyz fell victim to the June 2010 violence, which lasted four days, and left more than 400 people dead and nearly 2,000 houses destroyed. Starting the morning of June 11, after a fight broke out between a group of ethnic Uzbeks and Kyrgyz in the center of Osh, the largest city in southern Kyrgyzstan, crowds of ethnic Kyrgyz repeatedly attacked ethnic Uzbek neighborhoods, looting and setting fire to shops and homes, and killing people who remained.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people, mostly ethnic Uzbeks, were displaced fleeing the violence. There are strong indications that some military and police forces, either knowingly or unwittingly, facilitated attacks on ethnic Uzbek neighborhoods.\n\nIn the aftermath, Human Rights Watch research showed that the efforts at holding those responsible for the violence accountable was skewed against ethnic Uzbeks. The police led violent sweep operations in ethnic Uzbek neighborhoods, beating and insulting residents, looting their homes, and arbitrarily arresting hundreds of people. Ethnic Uzbeks told Human Rights Watch that investigators demanded bribes in exchange for not pressing charges, or to secure their release.\n\nLaw enforcement officers routinely ill-treated and tortured people detained in connection with the June violence. Human Rights Watch staff documenting abuses in the aftermath of the violence received accounts from people who had marks of beatings on their bodies. Human Rights Watch received credible information at that time about torture and ill-treatment in 65 cases.\n\nJune 2010 trials were also marred by serious violations of fair trial standards, harassment and physical attacks against lawyers, defendants, and even independent monitors during hearings. Human Rights Watch documented these violations in a June 2011 report “Distorted Justice.”\n\nCourtroom attacks continued in protracted related proceedings. In March 2013, women in an Osh courthouse attacked an ethnic Uzbek defendant, including throwing a bottle and a bag at him. The women screamed at the judges and beat security officers as the women tried to get at the defendant. At Askarov’s Supreme Court hearing on May 13, 2020, aggressive observers insulted and threatened Askarov’s wife and his lawyers.\n\nAzimjon Askarov\n\nOn May 13, 2020, Kyrgyzstan’s Supreme Court, in an egregious miscarriage of justice, upheld Askarov’s lifetime prison sentence. Askarov, 69, is a human rights defender from Bazar-Kurgan in southern Kyrgyzstan. He was arrested in June 2010, and found guilty of participating in mass disturbances, inciting ethnic hatred, and abetting the murder of a police officer. Like so many other cases at the time, Askarov’s investigation and trial were marred by allegations of torture and physical attacks on Askarov’s lawyer and on the defendants that seriously undermined the integrity of the hearings.\n\nIn 2016, the UN Human Rights Committee found that Askarov had been arbitrarily detained and tortured, and called for Askarov’s immediate release and the quashing of his conviction. Kyrgyzstan has persistently declined to carry out the ruling, failing to uphold its international legal obligations. Askarov, whose health has notably declined over the last 10 years, languishes in prison.\n\nGovernment Efforts to Address Ethnic Tensions\n\nThe Kyrgyz government has taken some steps to address and mitigate ethnic tensions since June 2010, but these efforts have not gone far enough and have had little impact on addressing grievances that persist, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nMost notably, the Kyrgyz government agreed to an independent investigation by the Kyrgyzstan Inquiry Commission led by Dr. Kimmo Kiljunen. In May 2011, the commission issued its findings and recommendations. The Kyrgyz government acknowledged that the commission carried out an “unbiased investigation.”\n\nBut the government dismissed outright the commission’s findings that ethnic Uzbeks had disproportionately suffered attacks, loss of life, and injury in the violence. Kyrgyz authorities have not carried out many of the report’s recommendations. They include giving Uzbek language “special status at municipal and regional levels in southern Kyrgyzstan,” and ensuring that June 2010 “prosecutions conform with international fair trial standards.”\n\nAfter the report was published, the Kyrgyz parliament passed a resolution declaring Dr. Kiljunen persona non grata.\n\nIn 2013, the Kyrgyz government established a State Agency for Local Government Affairs and Interethnic Relations, tasked, among other things, with “taking measures for the free and equal development of ethnic groups of the Kyrgyz Republic and ensuring their rights.” The agency was envisaged as playing a key role in mitigating ethnic tensions, including by establishing 23 community-based reception centers to “create an early warning system for interethnic conflicts.”\n\nThe CERD in May 2018 and the UN special rapporteur on minority issues, who visited Kyrgyzstan in December 2019, have expressed concern about the agency and the lack of public awareness about the centers. Indeed, when asked about the centers, an Osh-based human rights defender told Human Rights Watch, “Actually, this is the first I am hearing of it – from you!” The UN committee said that Kyrgyzstan should take “all steps necessary to facilitate access by minorities to justice.”\n\nProblematically, both the director and deputy director of the agency have in recent years claimed that ethnic minorities in Kyrgyzstan do not face discrimination or violations of their rights.\n\nThe government asserted in its 2017 report to CERD that “special attention is paid to ensuring that the different ethnic communities are represented in law enforcement agencies,” but did not present any data regarding the ethnic composition of the police. The government noted that two judges at the Supreme Court are members of an ethnic minority, but did not present data about the ethnic composition of the judiciary more broadly. According to government data from December 2019, ethnic Uzbeks make up just 1.2 percent of all civil servants in the country.\n\nThree human rights defenders in southern Kyrgyzstan who regularly interact with law enforcement and courts of law as part of their human rights activities told Human Rights Watch that over the last 10 years, they have not observed a noticeable increase in the number of ethnic minorities in law enforcement or the judiciary. The numbers “aren’t at all proportionate, and where [there are ethnic minorities], it’s just lower level staff,” one human rights defender said.\n\nSteps Forward\n\nEven in the midst of the violent clashes in June 2010, many ethnic Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, and Russians saved the lives of their neighbors of other ethnicities, often at great risk to themselves. \n\nTen years later, in June 2020, it seems that in some communities in southern Kyrgyzstan, people of different ethnicities are rallying, this time in response to the global pandemic, which has had such a huge impact on health and deprived many of their livelihoods.\n\nA local human rights defender told Human Rights Watch that in their town outside Osh, ethnic Uzbek and Kyrgyz have been working together during the pandemic to respond to the community’s needs. Another rights defender in Osh separately said that since quarantine measures were imposed to stem the spread of Covid-19, there has been a decline in anti-Uzbek commentary in the media and on the streets.\n\nWhile some communities have found ways to move past the June 2010 violence, the Kyrgyz government still has a responsibility to acknowledge and provide accountability for past abuses.\n\nThe government should heed recommendations from rights groups and UN bodies to reopen proceedings in cases related to the event of June 2010 for which torture allegations were not investigated, or there were serious breaches of fair trial standards. The authorities should also meaningfully address underlying grievances, such as ethnic representation in law enforcement and the judiciary.\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n$50\n$100\n$250\n$500\n$1000\nOther\nDONATE NOW\nRegion / Country\nEurope/Central Asia\nKyrgyzstan\nMORE READING\nJune 4, 2020 News Release\nKyrgyzstan: Rights Defender Under House Arrest\nMay 11, 2020 Dispatches\nKyrgyzstan Should Grant Rights Defender His Freedom\nREPORTS\nJuly 30, 2025 Report\nDisrupted, Throttled, and Blocked\nState Censorship, Control, and Increasing Isolation of Internet Users in Russia\nJune 3, 2025 Report\nHunted From Above\nRussia’s Use of Drones to Attack Civilians in Kherson, Ukraine\nMOST VIEWED\nNovember 25, 2019 Report\nA Dirty Investment\nAugust 20, 2025 Report\nDR Congo: M23 Mass Killings Near Virunga National Park\nDecember 7, 2011 Report\n\"How Come You Allow Little Girls to Get Married?\"\nAugust 16, 2016 Report\n“We’re Afraid for Their Future”\nAugust 29, 2024 Video\nSouth Korea’s Digital Sex Crime Deepfake Crisis\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\nDONATE NOW\nGet Updates On Rights Issues Worldwide\nSign Up\nConnect With Us\nBlueSky\nX\nFacebook\nYouTube\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nTikTok\nFooter menu\nContact UsCorrectionsPrivacy PolicyPermissionsSite MapChild SafeguardingText Version\n© 2025 Human Rights Watch\nHuman Rights Watch | 350 Fifth Avenue, 34th Floor | New York, NY 10118-3299 USA | t 1.212.290.4700\nHuman Rights Watch is a 501(C)(3) nonprofit registered in the US under EIN: 13-2875808\nHuman Rights Watch cookie preferences\nWe use cookies, tracking technologies, and third-party analytics tools to better understand who is using the website and improve your experience.

Rainfall levels reached those last seen during Eta and Iota in 2020, pushing dams to their limits. Although Sara has dissipated, rainfall continues across parts of Central America. The storm, which formed over the Caribbean, drew moisture from the Pacific Ocean, bringing additional rain to El Salvador and southern Honduras. Guatemala has also reported damage from Sara’s rains. The risk of landslides remains high across the region, with soils still highly saturated.\nHonduras\nAt present, authorities report damage in 17 of 18 departments and 85 of 298 municipalities, with more than 127,716 people affected. Over 6,738 people are in 95 active shelters, 3,227 houses have been damaged, 226 destroyed, and two fatalities have been confirmed. Road infrastructure, drinking water and sanitation systems, and electricity services have sustained significant damage, particularly in Atlántida.\nNationwide, 41 vehicle crossings are impassable, 53 roads are damaged, 4 destroyed, 305 streets are affected, 248 destroyed, and 1,797 communities remain cut off. While rainfall has decreased in Gracias a Dios, Colón, and Olancho, intermittent rains are forecast in the coming days for northern, southwestern, and southern departments.\nBelize\nAuthorities report no casualties, but officials note that water levels continue to rise and will monitor the situation in the coming days. The Government highlights the potential need for search and rescue operations and has advised downstream residents to evacuate flood-prone areas. At least 162 people are currently in 10 official shelters and 3 private shelters. Authorities are prioritizing water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) needs, particularly in the South and Cayo districts, while health teams monitor water quality in shelters.\nGuatemala\nTropical Storm Sara caused river floods, landslides on roads, and flooding, prompting a national orange alert declared on 14 November. The National Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology, and Hydrology (INSIVUMEH) continues to monitor the situation, while the National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction (CONRED) carries out preparedness actions. Authorities report 50,240 people affected, 337 displaced, 21 sheltered, 122 houses with minor damage, 200 with moderate damage, and 15 with severe damage, with 61 emergencies addressed overall. Rainfall from Sara led to the suspension of UN missions in Petén, Izabal, and northern Alta Verapaz from 16 to 18 November as well.\nEl Salvador\nAccording to the National Shelter Directorate, authorities report three active shelters housing 30 people. Reported damage includes 9 river overflows, 7 urban floods, 6 landslides, 21 obstructed roads, 91 flooded homes and 5 homes with structural damage. The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources’ Environmental Observatory highlights a high likelihood of continued urban flooding, flash floods, and river overflows along the coastal strip, volcanic range, and eastern regions.\nCosta Rica & Panama\nTropical Storm Sara brought heavy rain to parts of Panama and Costa Rica, with both countries already issuing alerts earlier in the week due to heavy rains from Rafael. In Costa Rica, intense rainfall since early November has affected the Central and Northern Pacific regions, causing river overflows, landslides, road destruction, and other impacts, forcing evacuations and rescues in danger zones.\nAs of 18 November, authorities in Costa Rica reported 5,566 incidents related to floods, river overflows, and landslides, resulting in destroyed homes, vehicles, and roads, and 3,418 people seeking safety in 57 temporary shelters across 41 of the country’s 84 cantons, affecting more than 633 communities. Five people have died, and five remain missing.\nDisclaimer\nUN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\nTo learn more about OCHA's activities, please visit https://www.unocha.org/.\nReport details\nPrimary country\nHonduras\nOther countries\nBelizeCosta RicaEl SalvadorGuatemalaNicaraguaPanama\nSource\nUN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\nDisasters\nCosta Rica: Floods - Nov 2024Tropical Storm Sara - Nov 2024\nFormat\nSituation Report\nThemes\nCoordinationDisaster ManagementFood and NutritionShelter and Non-Food ItemsWater Sanitation Hygiene\nDisaster types\nFloodLand SlideTropical Cyclone\nLanguage\nEnglish\nShare\nShare this on Facebook\nShare this on X\nPost this on LinkedIn\nShare report link\nRelated Content\nHonduras + 6 more Centroamérica: Tormenta Tropical Sara - Flash Update No. 2 (al 18 de noviembre 2024)\nFormat\nSituation Report Source OCHA Posted 19 Nov 2024 Originally published 18 Nov 2024\nCosta Rica Costa Rica | Floods caused by tropical cyclones: Early Action Protocol Annual Report (MDRCR024)\nFormat\nSituation Report Source IFRC Posted 16 May 2025 Originally published 16 May 2025\nHonduras + 1 more Honduras: Monitoreo de la Respuesta Humanitaria - Boletín n° 2 | Julio-diciembre 2024\nFormat\nEvaluation and Lessons Learned Source OCHA Posted 13 Mar 2025 Originally published 13 Mar 2025\nHonduras Honduras: Tormenta Tropical Sara - Flash Update No. 1 (al 18 de noviembre del 2024)\nFormat\nSituation Report Sources OCHAUNCT Honduras Posted 27 Nov 2024 Originally published 18 Nov 2024\nBLOG\nLABS\nABOUT US\nTERMS\nCONTACT\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nOCHA Services\nRelated Platforms\nHumanitarian Action\nCentral Emergency Response Fund\nOther OCHA Services\nFinancial Tracking Service\nHumanitarian Data Exchange\nHumanitarian ID\nReliefWeb Response\nInter-Agency Standing Committee\nOCHA website\nReliefWeb\nVirtual OSOCC\n  More OCHA Services\nOpens in a new window\nService provided by\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\nUN OCHA United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\nOCHA coordinates the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises.

Heather Chairez\nThe Official United States Marine Corps Public Website\nPRINT\nSHARE\nCAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. --\nAlmost two weeks after Hurricane Eta, a category 4 storm, ripped through Central America with torrential rain and heavy winds, Hurricane Iota, another category 4 storm, hit the already strained region.\nHurricanes Eta and Iota hit Honduras hard with winds surpassing 100 mph and caused more than 6 feet of flooding.\nThe storms affected more than a third of the population causing destruction of homes, extreme flooding and deadly mud slides.\nAs the winds and rain demolished buildings across the country, four buildings in Puerto Lempira, Honduras, stood strong – so strong that locals abandoned their homes and took shelter in them.\nThese buildings were built by U.S. Marines and Sailors from Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force – Southern Command five years ago.\nThe SPMAGTF-SC is comprised of mostly Marines and Sailors from U.S. Marine Corps Forces Reserve. During the 2020 iteration, the task force continued the enduring partnership within the region by safely forward deploying more than 60 Marines and Sailors into the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility, while the remainder was on standby to rapidly respond to support partner nations with humanitarian assistance and disaster relief from Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.\n“...These same structures are now saving the lives in the aftermath of two powerful hurricanes.\"\n Chief Warrant Officer 3 Calvin Gatch III, a SPMAGTF-SC engineer equipment officer\nIn 2015 and 2016, SPMAGTF-SC supported Honduras by building three schools and enhancing the quality of structure within the local hospital center that could sustain the winds of a tropical storm.\n“Today, in 2020, these same structures are now saving the lives in the aftermath of two powerful hurricanes,” said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Calvin Gatch III, an engineer equipment officer with the SPMAGTF-SC 2019 iteration who helped maintain those structures with a team of Marine engineers. “The structures are now providing shelter to families within the local population because many have nowhere else to live after the hurricane damage.”\nTo begin their 2015 deployment in Honduras, the logistics element of the task force built three schools from existing structures that were falling apart. Prior to this, the children and teachers of the local community were holding classes in huts.\nAs the SPMAGTF-SC Marines laid the building foundation, they also built long-lasting relationships in the local area.\nKoritza Mejia, the current governor of Gracias a Dios, which is the department or province where Puerto Lempira is located in, was an active member of the community in 2015 when the construction projects began. Now, as the governor of the department, she said she has seen the lasting benefits of the work the Marines did.\n“Before these buildings existed, the children who are now cared for in these educational centers, were in class under trees or in the corridors of some church,” said Mejia through a Spanish to English translator.\nThe community lacked books, desks and even things to write with. Therefore, during the 2016 deployment of the task force, 46 reserve centers from across the country donated these basic school supplies that greatly affected the condition of the schools, said Gatch.\nLAYING THE CEMENT\nPhoto by Cpl. Kimberly Aguirre\nDOWNLOAD\nDETAILS\nSHARE\nSince the first iteration of the SPMAGTF-SC, who deployed in 2015, schools in Puerto Lempira have increased by 11 classrooms, five teachers and nearly 400 students due to the ongoing maintenance of the schools.\n“For the first time, these children are in decent and suitable places to be able to give them the opportunity to receive an education in a dignified space,” added Mejia.\nThe team of Marine engineers also improved the quality of the local hospital center by refurbishing the structure of the building and reinforcing the property’s security fencing.\nThe hospital in Puerto Lempira is the only hospital in the region that offers trauma services, and the hospital staff are currently saving lives from the natural disasters. The aftermath of the hurricanes caused many injuries to those in the area, needing immediate care.\n“All of these structures have supported our communities in responding to both the COVID-19 emergency and the two hurricanes,” said Mejia.\nGatch said through his experience in serving multiple deployments with the SPMAGTF-SC, he understands that Honduras is one of the most inaccessible regions in all of Central America, which created many challenges he and his team had to overcome.\n“Considering the numerous obstacles required to conduct operations in this area, it was an incredible feature for the Marine Corps to provide so much support to the educational and health systems,” he said.\nIn the face of the two recent hurricanes, USSOUTHCOM responded with a strong show of support. Together with components of USSOUTHCOM, non-government organizations and partner nation militaries from around the region, the combined team delivered more than 1.2 million pounds of aid and conducted more than 850 rescues to devastated communities in Central America. The SPMAGTF-SC began this strong show of support in 2015, laid a foundation of partnership and friendship, and recently completed its final deployment to the region in November.\n“The work the SPMAGTF-SC has accomplished continues to have such a significant impact on the lives of so many people years after completion and is a testament of fundamental Marine Corps capabilities and values,” said Gatch.\n\nTags\nHurricane Eta , Force Design , structures , Honduras , relations , Marine Corps Forces South , SOUTHCOM , sailors , Building , disaster relief\nHosted by Defense Media Activity - WEB.mil"

In 2023 it was the least funded in the world. Almost 30 per cent of its population is in need of humanitarian aid and an increased number of Hondurans are forced to move and seek refuge outside the country’s borders.\nPublished 20. Sep 2024\nHonduras\nMeanwhile, Honduras also continues to host a high number of people seeking asylum within the country or elsewhere in the region.\n\nHere are four things you should know about the crisis in Honduras.\n1. Widespread violence threatens the population\nExtortion, forced recruitment, sexual violence, threats and abuse are some of the reasons that force many Hondurans to leave their communities or seek refuge outside their country. Maras, gangs and organised crime are a permanent threat to a large part of the population and are a real obstacle for leading a normal life and even moving freely through the territory.\nAlthough homicides have been reduced in recent years, last year the rate was 31 per 100,000 people. Or 253 homicides per month on average.\nWomen and young people are especially vulnerable. In 2023, 380 were murdered: more than one per day. Of the total number of victims 38 per cent were young people between 18 and 30 years old. \"I would like to live normally and in peace,\" one internally displaced woman told the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC).\n\nSupport refugees and displaced people in 40 countries around the world. \nDonate now\n2. Thousands of migrants must pass through Honduras on their way to the United States\nDue to its geographic location, Honduras is a transit country for thousands of people traveling to the United States, many of them in highly vulnerable conditions and in need of protection.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, an average of more than 6,000 people per day entered Honduras’s borders. That year, more than 506,000 people of 110 different nationalities entered Honduras with an irregular status, straining national systems and the resources of humanitarian organisations.\nA large family group arrives at the migrant transit centre in Danli, Honduras. Photo: Ed Prior/NRC\n  3. Droughts and hurricanes are an additional threat \nHonduras is highly vulnerable to climatic events that each year cause floods, droughts and landslides, destruction of crops, homes, and public roads, affecting the poorest populations the most.\nIt’s estimated that over one million people live in at-risk areas and that climate change will affect many more in the short term, also due to the increase of vector-borne diseases like dengue fever.\n4. Poverty, inequality and food insecurity\nSixty per cent of the Honduran population lives on less than USD 5.5 a day, a poverty rate that is only surpassed in the region by Haiti. In addition, more than 2 million people are considered to be in food crisis. Inequality and poverty are historical and structural, and affect women and children the most.\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has been working in Honduras since 2014, meeting the needs of tens of thousands of people affected by violence and natural disasters. We assist those who are internally displaced, people who are in need of international protection, deported people, and their hosts. We do this through our protection from violence programming, counseling and legal assistance, emergency education, and livelihoods and shelter programmes.\nPeople who receive timely support can rebuild their lives and see themselves as masters of their future. “Today I do have dreams, I do have goals, to work towards and get ahead,\" said a woman, displaced by violence, after receiving emergency assistance and support from NRC while recovering.\nMore on\n#Migration\n#Neglected conflicts\nMedia centre\nCareers\nTenders\nNorwegian Refugee Council\nPrinsens gate 2\n0152 Oslo\nNorway\nSwitchboard (09-15 CET)\n+47 23 10 98 00\nnrc@nrc.no\nMedia hotline\n+47 90 56 23 29\nmedia@nrc.no\nDonor support (10.00-12.00/ 12.30-14.00 CET)\nPhone: +47 800 33 503\nSMS: +47 594 48 256\nfundraising@nrc.no\n90%\nOver 90 per cent of our global revenue goes directly to fulfil our purpose.\n  Privacy policy\n  About cookies\nNRC © 1996-2025 \n  \n \n \n \n \n Cookies\nWe and our selected partners would like to use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about you for statistical, functional and marketing purposes.

    "full_text": "Skip to main content (Press Enter).\nAir Force\nPHOTO DETAILS / DOWNLOAD HI-RES\nSOUTHCOM, partners prepare to respond to natural disasters\nPublished June 24, 2012\nBy Donna Miles\nAmerican Forces Press Service\nMIAMI --  \nPutting lessons learned from the 2010 earthquake response in Haiti into practice, U.S. Southern Command has entered this year's hurricane season ready to provide timely, effective aid should another disaster strike the region, command officials reported.\n\n\"We remain deliberately prepared,\" Southcom commander  Gen. Douglas M. Fraser reported to Congress in the lead-up to hurricane season, which kicked off this month.\n\n\"As we look at the hurricane season, we prepared for that, not only within our own headquarters, but with our partners in the region,\" Fraser said.\n\nSOUTHCOM's area of responsibility, which includes Central and South America and the Caribbean, is no stranger to natural disasters. The largest earthquake recorded worldwide in the 20th century occurred in 1960 in Valdivia, Chile. Mount Pelee's 1902 eruption in Martinique caused more than 30,000 deaths, and the 1985 Nevada del Ruiz eruption and mudslide in Colombia killed 25,000 people. Major flooding in northern Venezuela in 1999 left more than 20,000 dead.\n\nHaiti has been tormented throughout its history with cyclones, hurricanes, tropical storms, torrential rains, floods and earthquakes. Haiti's 7.0-magnitude earthquake in January 2010 left thousands dead and hundreds of thousands homeless. That disaster sparked the SOUTHCOM-led Operation Unified Response mission in support of the U.S. Agency for International Development's Office of Foreign Disaster Relief.\n\nAt the peak of that mission, Joint Task Force-Haiti included 22,000 service members -- 7,000 land-based and the rest operating aboard 33 Navy and Coast Guard vessels, 262 fixed-wing aircraft and 57 helicopters. They reopened the heavily damaged international airport at Port-au-Prince, repaired port facilities and delivered 2.6 million bottles of water, 2.9 million food rations, 17 million pounds of bulk food and 149,000 pounds of medical supplies into Haiti.\n\nThe task force also provided one of the largest medical outreach efforts in history, with humanitarian and engineering support continuing long after the six-month disaster response in Haiti concluded.\n\nThe mission proved to be a \"tremendous learning experience\" for SOUTHCOM that underscored the importance of close interagency and non-governmental cooperation, Army Maj. Gen. Gerald W. Ketchum, SOUTHCOM's director of theater engagement, told American Forces Press Service at the organization's headquarters here.\n\nThe response effort led to revisions in the command's disaster response plan, increases in its disaster-response capabilities and expanded disaster-preparedness outreach across the region, Ketchum said.\n\nCoincidentally, the SOUTHCOM headquarters staff was getting a demonstration of a new computer-networking tool to promote collaboration in the event of a natural disaster the very day Haiti's earthquake hit. The All Partners Access Network, initially introduced at U.S. Pacific Command, provides a standardized platform for coordinating efforts between the various interagency, non-governmental organization, international and military responders. The scenario being used to demonstrate the APAN system was a notional hurricane hitting Haiti and taking out its emergency response command-and-control capabilities.\n\nBut based on real-life events, the SOUTHCOM staff quickly took the demonstration live and hundreds of organizations began using APAN to coordinate a faster and more efficient relief response that saved lives. SOUTHCOM is now using the system as part of an improved framework for military support to civilian-led disaster relief operations, Fraser noted in his command's 2012 posture statement.\n\nMeanwhile, SOUTHCOM is collaborating with regional partners to increase their ability to prepare for and respond to natural disasters. Fraser described a three-part effort through SOUTHCOM's humanitarian assistance program, disaster preparedness projects and annual humanitarian assistance exercises.\n\nLast year, those efforts included building disaster-response warehouses, wells, potable water systems and emergency operations centers, he said. In fiscal year 2011, SOUTHCOM also conducted 169 projects designed to increase disaster preparedness in Central America, South America and the Caribbean.\n\nIn addition, the command supports the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency, a regional effort to increase disaster resilience and response capabilities among the 18 Caribbean nations involved.\n\nA new project SOUTHCOM sponsored in the wake of the Haiti earthquake involves forward-staged kits that provide disaster-response teams with essential services, including potable water, hybrid renewable power, communications and situational awareness.\n\n\"Past experience has demonstrated that one of the biggest challenges in providing an effective response is the ability to accurately assess the situation on the ground after communications go down and transportation infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed,\" Fraser noted in his commander's blog.\n\nPre-positioned Expeditionary Assistance Kits, or PEAKS, developed in partnership with the National Defense University, \"enable decision makers to gain a better understanding of how best to deploy relief efforts,\" he said.\n\nThe kits underwent a joint capability technology demonstration last year at Soto Cono Air Base, Honduras, less than a year after the program's inception, Fraser said. Joint Task Force-Bravo in Honduras, SOUTHCOM's main expeditionary organization, and members of Honduras' military and civil-relief agencies, put the kits to the test under realistic field conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, Fraser emphasized the importance of training to ensure the SOUTHCOM staff is prepared to support USAID, the lead federal agency for international disaster response, if called upon. This includes a joint operations course it hosts, with classes presented by USAID.\n\n\"This recurring training guarantees that when disaster strikes, U.S. Southern Command is ready to assist,\" Fraser said.\n\nAnd to ensure regional nations are as prepared as possible for disasters when they occur, many SOUTHCOM-sponsored exercises incorporate disaster-response scenarios or training activities that enhance capabilities and cooperation, Ambassador Carmen Martinez, SOUTHCOM's civilian deputy to the commander, said.\n\nThe Fuerzas Aliadas Humanitarias annual exercise series, sponsored by SOUTHCOM and executed by U.S. Army South, helps bring together regional militaries, civilian disaster management agencies and first responders to train in disaster relief and recovery efforts. The 2011 exercise, held in Trinidad and Tobago and Guatemala, included 640 participants from 27 nations to practice the national and international response to an imaginary earthquake.\n\nMartinez credited these efforts with building partner-nation capability, noting that no U.S. military forces were called on during last year's hurricane season to provide support.\n\n\"I think that is the direct result of the constant training and exercising and assisting of these nations, that they were able to take care of things themselves,\" she said. \"And I think that's a real tribute to the host nations. But it is also a tribute to the programs that U.S. Southern Command has conducted in the region.\"\n\nFEATURED NEWS\nSenior Leader Priorities\nMeink, Allvin, Saltzman outline strategies, priorities necessary to secure the nation\nDepartment of the Air Force bids farewell to SECAF 26\nKendall offers vision for the Air Force, Space Force of 2050\nSecAF Kendall visits information warfare headquarters, addresses importance of ‘getting it right’\nDAF senior leaders emphasize reoptimizing for GPC, ready Airmen for future fight\nInnovation\nNext-gen TOC-L systems announced to boost agile C2 capabilities\nACC leads radical change to USAF fleet maintenance, management\nA new era in testing: USAF TPS partners with Stanford, Silicon Valley for AI, emerging technologies course\nDAF announces Spark Tank 2025 finalists\nDAF Safety announces next generation safety reporting\nMAJCOM News\n317th AW showcases combat readiness in major AMC inspection\nInternational dignitaries, leaders commemorate Dayton Peace Accords\nAETC commander launches immersive learning challenge, proposals due May 15\nPACAF deputy commander says generational allies forge interoperability at Avalon International Airshow Symposium\nWOTS holds second graduation\nQUICK LINKS\nCAREERS\nGET SOCIAL WITH US\nOfficial United States Air Force Website\nHosted by Defense Media Activity - WEB.mil"

Porter\nMarch 22, 2018\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nIn the wake of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Team Rubicon was born on an ideal that military veterans’ and first responders’ skills and experiences could be repurposed for disaster response. Initially created as an international response organization, Team Rubicon quickly pivoted to building our domestic capacity in 2011, after identifying the need to further engage Greyshirts and support the homeland, due to the sheer frequency of disasters in the United States. \n  A patient receives care from a Team Rubicon volunteer in Puerto Cortes, Honduras.\nFor eight years, we’ve honed our craft with the aim of becoming the best damn disaster response organization in the world while relentlessly punching Mother Nature in the face. In fact, since 2011, our domestic operations have doubled in comparison to our international operations year after year ever since. However, 2018 is going to be a banner year for us. We’re extremely close to finalizing our certification as a World Health Organization Type 1 Mobile Emergency Medical Team, we’re relaunching our international portal and pipeline to better identify Greyshirts ready to respond internationally, and we’re creating robust training to prepare them for disasters abroad. We also just launched our first proactive international operation since 2012 and deployed alongside our brothers and sisters with the United States Navy and United States Southern Command as part of Operation Continuing Promise.\nContinuing Promise is a U.S. Southern Command training mission introduced in 2007. During the 2018 mission, Continuing Promise personnel will provide medical, environmental health, veterinary, and humanitarian assistance activities in select countries to strengthen partnerships and improve cooperation on many levels with partner nations, interagency organizations, and nongovernmental organizations. The purpose of Continuing Promise is to conduct civilian-military operations including humanitarian civil assistance, medical, dental, veterinary, and disaster response with partner nations and to show U.S. support and commitment to Central America, South America and the Caribbean.\n  Team Rubicon volunteers repairing and reinforcing buildings in Honduras.\n  This past week, we sent a cadre of instructors and medical personnel to Honduras. In the future, we’ll also send volunteers to Guatemala. Over 60 Team Rubicon members will provide instruction and certification of the American Heart Association Basic Life Saver and Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support, with support from our partners at Carolinas Healthcare System, to host-nation medical professionals. We’ll further leverage our experiences in deploying to rapid-onset disasters by providing instruction on civilian-military cooperation during humanitarian assistance and disaster response operations and how the host-nations plug-in to the United Nations’ coordination system. Team Rubicon personnel will also staff a medical clinic with the U.S. military and other NGOs, to provide medical and dental care to the residents of Honduras and Guatemala while also training their civilian healthcare providers on the United States’ best practices and pioneering technologies.\nWe kicked off Continuing Promise 2018 on March 15 in Puerto Cortes, Honduras. Over the weekend, a total of 151 patients were seen and we’re just getting started. Check out our operations page for regular updates. Operation Continuing Promise will come to a close in Tumaco, Colombia on May 10. \n  Looking to serve internationally or domestically?

Laura was Earth’s most expensive tropical cyclone of 2020, with $18.2 billion in damage. (Photo credit: Josiah Pugh)\nEarth was besieged by a record 50 billion-dollar weather disasters in 2020, the most such disasters ever recorded after adjusting for inflation, said insurance broker Aon (formerly called Aon Benfield) in its annual report issued January 25. The previous record was 46 billion-dollar weather disasters, set in 2010 and 2011. The annual average of billion-dollar weather disasters since records began in 1990 is 29.\nThe combined economic losses (insured and uninsured) from all 416 weather and earthquake disasters cataloged by Aon in 2020 was $268 billion (2020 USD). Most of the 2020 total, by far, came from weather-related disasters ($258 billion), 29% above the 2001-2020 inflation-adjusted average. Those numbers make 2020 the fifth costliest year on record for weather-related disasters.\nThe year was the most expensive ever for severe weather (including severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, and hail), with $63 billion in damage (previous record: $53 billion in 2011). More than 80% of the severe weather damage occurred in the U.S. in 2020, including the costliest severe weather outbreak in world history, according to Aon: an August 2020 event that featured a violent derecho in the U.S. midwest that caused $11 billion of the $12.6 billion in damage of the outbreak, the balance caused by tornadoes, hail, and other severe thunderstorms.\nInsured damage from wildfires in 2020 was $12 billion – the third highest on record, behind only 2017 and 2018. The year 2020 marked the third time in the past four years that global insured losses from wildfires exceeded $10 billion – a threshold never crossed prior to 2017. Remarkably, wildfire has caused more than $70 billion in insured losses since 2000, 75% of that in the past five years alone.\nFigure 1. Billion-dollar weather disasters 1992 – 2020, as cataloged by Aon. (Image credit: Jeff Masters)\nApproximately 8,100 people died in natural disasters (including earthquakes) in 2020, the lowest annual death toll in data going back to 2000. The deadliest natural disaster of 2020 was the monsoon flooding in India, which killed an estimated 1,922 people. Elsewhere in South Asia – particularly in Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh – another 1,100 people lost their lives to unusually heavy monsoon rains.\nThe most expensive disaster of 2020 was the summer monsoon flooding in China, which caused $35 billion in damage. According to statistics from EM-DAT, the international disaster database, that total ranks as the third-most expensive non-U.S. weather disaster since accurate records began in 1990, behind 1998 flooding in China ($48 billion 2020 dollars) and 2011 flooding in Thailand ($47 billion 2020 dollars). In the Aon database, the 2020 floods in China rank as the fourth-most expensive non-U.S. weather disaster on record.\nFigure 2. Rescuers brave floodwaters in Honduras to rescue people trapped by Hurricane Eta’s rains on November 6, 2020. (Image credit: Policia Nacional de Honduras)\nOne nation, Honduras, sees its costliest disaster on record\nBy comparing the Aon Benfield numbers to historical disaster costs at EM-DAT,  we see that Honduras was the only nation in 2020 that set a record for all-time most expensive weather-related disaster. (For comparison, seven nations had their most expensive weather-related natural disasters in history in 2019, two did so in 2018, three in 2017, four in 2016, and nine in 2015.)\nHonduras suffered $6 billion in damage (24% of its $25 billion GDP) from Hurricane Eta in 2020, tying with Hurricane Mitch in 1998 (also with damages of $6 billion in 2020 dollars) as the nation’s most expensive disaster on record. Mitch arguably was more devastating than Eta, though: When Mitch struck, the GDP of Honduras was less than half its current inflation-adjusted size, so the hurricane wiped out a larger share of the nation’s economy than Eta did. However, Eta was followed by another devastating hit from Hurricane Iota, which did much of its $1.3 billion in damage to Honduras. The one-two punch to Honduras from Eta and Iota rivaled that of Hurricane Mitch.\nFigure 3. U.S. weather disasters costing at least $1 billion in 2020. (Image credit: NOAA)\nU.S. had a record 27 billion-dollar weather disasters\nIn the U.S., there were a record 27 billion-dollar weather disasters, according to Aon, 22  according to NOAA. These are by far the highest totals on record in both databases, with the previous record, set in 2017, being 20 in Aon’s database and 17 in NOAA’s. The difference in the 2020 tallies results from Aon’s cataloguing one extra severe weather event, and listing five separate wildfire events that caused more than $1 billion in damage. NOAA lumped all the wildfires together as one billion-dollar event. NOAA’s 2020 billion-dollar weather disaster list included one drought event, 13 severe storm events, a record seven tropical cyclone events, and one wildfire event. Together, these events killed 262 people and cost over $95 billion.\nSince 1980, the U.S. has sustained 285 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters (2020 dollars). The total cost of these 285 events is $1.876 trillion. The U.S. disaster costs from billion-dollar weather events over the past five years (2016-2020) exceeded $606 billion, a record for any five-year period. Billion-dollar events account for 80-85% of the total U.S. losses for all weather-related disasters.\nNOAA’s 1980-2020 annual inflation-adjusted average is seven billion-dollar events, but over the past five years (2016-2020), the annual average has more than doubled, to 16.2 events. NOAA stated that the number and cost of disasters are increasing over time as a result of:\n– a combination of increased exposure (i.e., values at risk of possible loss);\n– vulnerability (i.e., how much damage at a location is caused by intensity [wind speed, flood depth]; and\n– climate change’s increasing the frequency of some types of extremes that lead to billion-dollar disasters.\nThe record number of U.S. disasters in 2020 led to the American Red Cross’s providing record levels of disaster sheltering in 2020, according to a December 2 article by E&E News.\nFigure 4. Global economic costs from weather-related disasters (adjusted for inflation), 1950-2020. Damages in 2020 were fifth-highest on record. (Image credit: Aon 2020 annual report)\nU.N. calls attention to ‘staggering’ rise in natural disasters\nAn October 13, 2020 report by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) had found a “staggering” rise in climate-related disasters, including extreme weather events: those nearly doubled, from 3,656 in 1980-1999 to 6,681 in 2000-2019, based on data from EM-DAT. The number of major floods more than doubled, from 1,389 to 3,254, and the incidence of destructive storms increased from 1,457 to 2,034.\nThe U.N. report blamed human-caused climate change as a significant factor in the increased disasters, and warned, “It is baffling that we willingly and knowingly continue to sow the seeds of our own destruction, despite the science and evidence that we are turning our only home into an uninhabitable hell for millions of people.” The U.N. report authors called attention to “industrial nations that are failing miserably on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to levels commensurate with the desired goal of keeping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius as set out in the Paris Agreement.”\nHere are 2020’s 50 billion-dollar weather disasters, as tabulated by Aon:\n1.

The $12.6 billion in damage from the severe weather outbreak that day made it the most expensive severe weather outbreak in world history. (Image credit: NOAA)\nThe 2020 breakdowns by month\nJanuary\n– Severe weather, U.S.: A powerful winter storm over central and eastern sections of the U.S. January 10-12 killed 12 and did $1.3 billion in damage. The storm brought a multi-day severe weather outbreak to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and Georgia, with 79 confirmed tornadoes.\n– Severe weather, Australia: A series of hailstorms that affected the Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne metro areas January 19-20 caused $1.8 billion in damage.\nFebruary\n– Windstorm Ciara, Europe: Windstorm Ciara killed 14 people and caused $2.7 billion in damage across 20 nations, primarily in western and central Europe, February 9-10.\n– Severe weather, U.S.: A severe weather outbreak on February 3-8 in the central and eastern U.S. spawned 37 tornadoes and killed five people, causing $1.5 billion in damage.\n– Severe weather, Australia: A powerful East Coast Low brought severe weather and flooding to Queensland and New South Wales February 2-11, causing $1.2 billion in damage.\nMarch\n– Severe weather, U.S.: A severe weather outbreak on March 2-5 in the U.S. featured an EF3 tornado that ravaged Nashville, Tennessee and an EF4 tornado east of Nashville. The outbreak killed 25 people and caused $2.5 billion in damage. The damage from the Nashville tornado alone was $1.5 billion, making it one of the top-six most expensive tornadoes in U.S. history.\n– Severe weather, U.S.: A severe weather outbreak on March 27-30 across parts of the central and eastern U.S. spawned 24 tornadoes and caused $2.9 billion in damage. The hardest-hit states were Arkansas, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa and Indiana.\nApril\n– Severe weather, U.S.: A severe weather outbreak on April 6-9 in the Midwest, Plains, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic U.S. brought widespread damage totaling $3 billion, mainly due to hail and high winds.\n– Severe weather, U.S.: A severe weather outbreak on April 10-14 in the Midwest, Plains, Mid-Atlantic, and southeastern U.S. featured 138 tornadoes, with three EF4 tornadoes and 12 EF3 tornadoes. At least 38 people were killed, and damage was estimated at $3.6 billion. The 32 people killed by tornadoes during the outbreak made it the deadliest tornado outbreak since April 27-30, 2014. The April 12, 2020 EF4 tornado that began in Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi was 2.25 miles wide – the widest tornado in Mississippi history, and not far from the world-record 2.6-mile-wide tornado that hit El Reno, Oklahoma on May 31, 2013.\n– Winter weather, China: A massive snowstorm dumped over two feet of snow in northeastern China on April 19-25, causing damages of $1.2 billion.\n– Severe weather, U.S.: A severe weather outbreak on April 21-24 in the Plains, Mid-Atlantic, and southeastern U.S. killed seven and did $1.5 billion in damage.\n– Severe weather, U.S.: A severe weather outbreak on April 27-30 in the Midwest, Plains, and southeastern U.S did $1.1 billion in damage. There were no fatalities reported.\n– Flooding, Canada: Flooding in Canada April 26-30 killed one and did $1.3 billion in damage.\n– Flooding, Iran: Flooding in Iran February 24-April 30 killed 23 and cost $1.5 billion.\nMay\n– Severe weather, U.S.: A severe weather outbreak May 4-5 in the Midwest, Plains, and southeastern U.S did $1.5 billion in damage.\n– Severe weather, U.S.: A severe weather outbreak and flooding May 16-21 in the Midwest, Plains, and southeastern U.S killed one and did $2.1 billion in damage.\n– Severe weather, U.S.: A severe weather outbreak on May 20-24 in the U.S. Midwest, Plains, and Rockies killed two and did $1.8 billion in damage.\n– Cyclone Amphan, India and Bangladesh: After peaking as a category 5 storm with 160 mph winds, a weakening Cyclone Amphan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Amphan) made landfall on May 20 near the India-Bangladesh border as a category 2 storm with 100 mph winds. The cyclone triggered evacuations of 4.2 million people and destroyed or damaged 2.8 million homes in India and 225,000 in Bangladesh. Amphan killed 133 people and left damages estimated at $15 billion, making it the most expensive Indian Ocean tropical cyclone in history. Of that total, $13.5 billion was in India – their most expensive tropical cyclone on record and second-costliest disaster in history, exceeded only by flood damages from the 2014 monsoon season ($17.4 billion 2020 dollars). The $1.5 billion in damage to Bangladesh from Amphan made it their third-costliest tropical cyclone on record.\n– Severe weather, U.S.: An extensive severe weather outbreak hit Texas and the southeastern U.S. May 27-28. Supercells produced swaths of large and significant hail, notably near San Antonio, with hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter. Damaging winds hit the Houston metro area, with a gust of 65 mph reported in Harris County. Damage was $1.5 billion, with no fatalities.\nJune\n– Severe weather, Canada: Severe thunderstorms in Calgary, Canada on June 13-14 brought damaging hail and flooding, causing damages of $1.4 billion – the fifth most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history.
