And I don't mean any sub categories of those items, I just mean strictly the following items: [all metrics]. If it does, return yes (otherwise return no, nothing else) and then for each occurence, list the country, the metric, and the relevant months. Do this for all countries and all metrics with only one metric on each line. Treat it like a csv and list it month-year as in mm-yyyy, and list all years, don't just go month-year to month-year. List every month and every year. So the format is country 1, metric 1, month1-year1, month2-year2, and so forth, with a new line being required for a new metric or country."
