And I don't mean any sub categories of those items, I just mean strictly the following items: [all metrics]. If it does, return yes (otherwise return no, nothing else) and then for each occurence, list the country, the metric, and the relevant months. Do this for all mentioned countries and all metrics with only one metric on each line. Treat it like a csv and list it month-year as in mm-yyyy, and list all years, don't just go month-year to month-year. Ensure it is numeric. If you do not know the month or year, please move on to the next one and don't return just the text mm-yyyy. List every month and every year. So the format is country 1, metric 1, month1-year1, month2-year2, and so forth, with a new line being required for a new metric or country."

If there are multiple month-years for a single country-metric pair, please list them all on the same line separated by commas. If there are multiple metrics for a single country, please list each metric on its own line. If there are multiple countries, please list each country-metric pair on its own line. Please do not return anything other than what I have specified. If there are no occurrences of any of the metrics for any of the countries, please just return no."
